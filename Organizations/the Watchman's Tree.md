# Crossrow
<aside><img src=https://weatherfactory.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/boh-crossrow-1920x1080-1.png></aside>

> **Crossrow**, in a garden city of the far West, is an establishment of uncertain age. It’s a gloriously decaying garden-mansion that specialises in [[nyctodromy]], patronised by [[Sunset Celia]].[^1]

>Crossrow specialises in musical manuscripts, nyctodromy and the Wisdom called Birdsong, merrily guarding its secrets in a gloriously decaying, surprisingly complex manor house in the deep south.[^2]

Crossrow is a library of [[the Watchman's Tree]], located in the New World. It is associated with [[Birdsong]] and [[Nyctodromy]], and patronised by [[Sunset Celia]].
# The Haustorium
<aside><img src=https://weatherfactory.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/haustorium-final-1024x576-1.jpg></aside>

>An enclave beyond [[the Evening Isles]] (and in [[the Bounds]]) established by an alliance of Catholic friars with Incan magicians. It preserves those things that are elsewhere considered unwise to preserve. The Haustorium lies beneath the hand of [[the Crowned Growth]]. It is in no way a safe place to visit, nor even really to communicate with. It's probably not even a good idea to dream about it.
>- [[Enigma#Library - the Haustorium]]

The Haustorium is a library of the [[the Watchman's Tree]] in [[South America]]. Its protector is [[the Generous of Hosts]][^10].

# The Invisible Serapeum
