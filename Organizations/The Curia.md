> In the 18th century, a secretive cabal of scholars established the 'Curia of the Isle' to manage Hush House, making it a haven of knowledge until 1896 when a disgraced Librarian brought the House to penury.

After the [[Dewulfs|Dewulf]] line ended with [[Eva Dewulf]]'s (purported) death, in 1785[^7] a group of scholars established the Curia of the Isle, an organisation that controlled [[Hush House]] until it was bankrupt by [[Thirza Blake]][^9] and the [[Nocturnal Branch]] took control in 1896[^8].

Most members of the Curia were not [[Long]][^6], although [[Fraser Strathcoyne]] is immortal and the Ligeian [[Rowena]] likely held the position of Secretary Persistent.

The Curia had seven positions[^1]:
- [[#Librarians]]
- [[#Secretary Salvant]]
- [[#Secretary Vigilant]]
- [[#Secretary Enigmatic]]
- [[#Secretary Nunciant]]
- [[#Secretary Persistent]]
- [[#Treasurer]]

The Curia of the Isle has unclear connections to the [[House of Lethe]]. [[Ambrose Westcott]], the first librarian, was known to be a member[^10], and the three Vaults beneath were created during the Curia period.
# Librarians
