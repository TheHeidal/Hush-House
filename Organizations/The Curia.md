After the [[Dewulf]] line ended with [[Eva Dewulf]]'s purported death, in 1785[^7] a group of scholars established the Curia of the Isle, an organisation that controlled [[Hush House]] until the seventh librarian, [[Thirza Blake]] bankrupt them[^9] and the [[Nocturnal Branch]] took control in 1896[^8] until the 

Most members of the Curia were not [[Long]][^6], although [[Fraser Strathcoyne]] is immortal and the Ligeian [[Rowena]] likely held the position of Secretary Persistent.

The Curia had seven positions[^1]. Known position-holders include:
- The [Librarians|Librarian] of Hush House
- The [[Secretary Salvant]]: [[Ehsan Fekri]][^2]
- The [[Secretary Vigilant]]: [[George Collers]][^4]
- The [[Secretary Enigmatic]]: [[C.C.]]
- The [[Secretary Nunciant]]: [[Dr Ibn al-Adim]]
- The [[Secretary Persistent]]: Likely [[Rowena]]
- The [[Treasurer of the Curia]]: [[Fraser Strathcoyne]][^5]

The Curia of the Isle has unclear connections to the [[House of Lethe]]. [[Ambrose Westcott]], the first librarian, was known to be a member[^10], and the three Vaults beneath were created during the Curia period.
