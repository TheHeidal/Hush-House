The laws governing what knowledge mortals can know, the group of [[Hours]] that enforce that law, and the hours in that group. The libraries of the Watchman's Tree are a compromise between Calyptra and [[the Watchman]][^3].

The three members of Calyptra are likened to the three colors of flowers on the tree.
- [[the Velvet]] is [[the Black Flower]], for secrecy[^2]
# The Flowers
## The White Flower
[[The Velvet]] is the Black Flower of the Calyptra[^5]. She hides knowledge.
## The Red Flower
[[The Mare-in-the-Tree]] is the Red Flower of Calyptra.[^2]. She destroys knowledge.
She is also called 'the temptation of suffering'[^4]
## The White Flower
[[The Madrugad]] is the White Flower of Calyptra[^1][^7]. She causes knowledge to be forgotten, and is called the death of wisdom[^6].
# Texts referring to Calyptra
## [[The Three and the Three (Kerisham Manuscript)]]
The three members are referred to as the three flowers on the [[the Watchman's Tree]]. It is asserted that they are the patrons of [[the Watchman's Tree]]. They are called:
- Blood
- Snow
- Soot
obviously meaning red, white, and black.
They are also called
- Night
- Dawn
- Eclipse
Eclipse and soot could be the same,  although I would prefer that Night=Soot, Eclipse=Blood. Snow and Dawn both suggest [[the Madrugad]] to me, as a winter hour mentioned in the tooltip for Dawn.
## [[The Three and the Three (St Chiavi Manuscript)]],
It is stated that [[the Watchman]] is the patron of the Watchman's tree and that Calyptra would end it if they could.
# [[The White Book of Brittany]]
The white flower is called 'the death of wisdom.'
