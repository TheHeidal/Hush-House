The Chancel is a group of three hours which decides who count as [[Hours]].[^4] They have decreed that [[the City Unbuilt]] should not exist.

Their members are referred to as:[^2]
- [[the Chancel]] (I Hate This Game)
- [[the Cruciate]]
- [[the Rode]]
The Cruciate is known to be the [[The Twins|The Sister-and-Witch]] (but not the Witch-and-Sister).[^3]

[[The Church of the Unconquered Sun]] worshipped only one member of the Chancel, implying only one is a solar hour[^2].

The chancels members are also known as _Threshold, Mirror and Shell_.[^1]. 
Threshold is probably [[the Horned-Axe]] and Mirror must be [[the Meniscate]], which would be the one Solar hour. Shell is [[The Twins|The Sister-and-Witch]]


[[The Three and the Three (St Chiavi Manuscript)]] says the Chancel is the judgement of [[Janus]]
