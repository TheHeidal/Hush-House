A race of lots of weird kinds of bug-people who preceded [[humanity]]. They might have worshipped the [[gods-from-stone]].

According to [[Cucurbit Prisoner Records 1927]], some humans are descended from them. The usual phrase is some variation of "The cross did not die but passed within."

Frequently associated with secret or lost knowledge, as in [[The Bee-Keeper's Ends]] and [[Kitling Ripe's Tasty Treats]].

Known People with Cross lineage:
- [[Fraser Strathcoyne]][^1]
- [[Mehrdad]][^2]
- [[Mr Peter Agdistis]]

Known Cross-Kinds include:
- [[The Seglaz-kind]][^3]
- [[the Wyrmefota-kind]][^3]
- [[the Glaeterfloge-kind]][^3]
- [[the Blomberende-kind]]: Rather like bees
- [[the Thritige-kind]]
- [[the Dragon-kinds]]
It's unclear if [[the Travelling Kinds]] are a Cross-Kind.
