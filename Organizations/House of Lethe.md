An order of [[Long|immortals]][^6] who are forgotten by drinking from [[the Spring]] at [[Port Noon]]. While some sources suggest all members are immortal (as the Silver Vault considers the Curia including non-long as evidence it is not the Order[^6]), other sources mention Know members such as [[Ambrose Westcott]][^1].
The order believes they were inspired by [[the Vagabond|the Centipede]][^5].

Later, they became known as the Ordo Limiae, and even later, the Obliviates[^7]. They now might control [[The Curia|the Curia of the Isle]].

# History
## House of Lethe
Known Branches:
- [[Aleppine branch]]
- [[the Damascene branch]]
- [[Theban branch]]
## Ordo Limiae
The Ordo Limiae is said to have maintained a secret enclave at the source of the river Limia, in the Roman province of Hispania Gallaecia[^2], but also to have made their home at [[Port Noon]][^3].
## Obliviates
According to [[Those Indignities Perpetrated by the Deceitful Fraternity of Obliviates]], they had passed the height of their power by the 16th century.

In the Baronial Period, they experienced a schism into the [[Birds of a Feather]] and [[Worms of a Scale]][^1].

# The Conflict Between Bird and Worm
The [[Worms of a Scale]] wanted to return the [[gods-from-stone]] in order to perpetuate History, and thought they could do so by bringing seven pentiments into the same History[^8].
# Oaths:
## The Silver Chain
An oath forbidding "men to lie with women, or women with men" to prevent [[the Crime of the Sky]][^2].
## The Iron Chain
An oath which binds every resident of [[Port Noon|Noon]], to remain hidden from the world, 'so that [[Calyptra|the Calyptra]] might not look upon us, so that [[the Chancel]] might not hear our names, so that the Hours might not devour us.'[^3]
## The Ivory Chain
An oath forbidding "commerce with the Hours"[^4] except [[the Elegiast]].
