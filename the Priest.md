# Lock-Scars
>The deacon reads now from the Book of [[St Respicius]]: 'Bronze shapes, but the heart labours. Hunger shows the red cup, and sickness the snow. The Lantern knows, while Moth understands. And the sword, when it comes, is its own answer.'
## Heart
> The Vision of the Pines
> In the vision the trunks of the pines are lit by the fire but the shadows of the dancers come and go in a zoetrope flicker. With each stroke of the drum I am freed from another slip of skin, but it is not St Agnes who holds the knife, and at last I can bear no more and all the pent screams burst from me -
> My congregation have waited all night in vigil. I am awake. The only wound I can see is the one above my heart, and that will heal in time. But the scar will remain.
## Grail
## Moth
> The Vision of the Shearing
> In the vision I see our wings, and I hear the rustling as we unfurl them to the shears. Our abdomens were patterned black and white like bandages, and our beaks scissor-sharp. Fold us in the chrysalis and lock us in the dark. Break our eggs and steal our hair and watch for us within.
> My congregation have waited all night in vigil. I am awake. The double wound on my back will heal. But the scar will remain. [Health has been permanently converted to a Scar. There are always seven Marks; you will need seven Lock-Scars. There is always a way, though the way may be narrow.]

The Pries sees a vision of [[the Carapace Cross]].
# Sermons
## Forge
> 'The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and it was changed unto ash.'
> 'We are all changed. Sometimes we are changed to that which does not live - sometimes to that which that has never lived - sometimes, to something glorious. And sometimes, we change ourselves. This is the crossroads  where the Sun's shadow waits.'
## Winter
> 'He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, for Winter waiteth not forever.'
> 'Close your mouths. Close your ears. Listen.'
## Heart
> 'The hearts of the false shall be taken from them when they cease; but the hearts of the true cease not.'
> 'In the House of the Sun, the dance of the angels of Glory does not cease. [[Cast-down Hours|Those who were cast down]], wave or wound or snow, are gone from the House, and as long as their parts in the dance are filled, they may never return. Therefore let us join hands, and add our little steps to the dance.'
## Grail
> 'Thou hast walked in the way of our Mother; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.'
> 'Our souls dwell each in the house which is our flesh. Our senses are the windows, and each sense has its attendant appetites. To leave the appetites unsatisfied, is to leave the windows uncared for. And who would choose to live in a house with filthy windows?'
## Moth
> 'They have led me, and brought me first into darkness, then into light.'
> 'The Glory demands truth. When we are clad in lies, then it shall burn them from us.'
