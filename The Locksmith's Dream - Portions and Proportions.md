# Summary
The second volume of [[Teresa Galmier]]'s examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans. The frontispiece has been slashed with a razor.
# Reading
In this volume, Galmier records fewer dreams, and explicates more of her own elaborate theories. 'We see this again and again: what is below can't escape what is above.'
# Read
The finest artisans all dream of [[the White Door]] in the end. I'm no artisan, only a scholar. I think there's a Secret that all these artisans know, but I think that Secret is only half the story.'

# Speculation
The other half of the secret is referenced in [[The Locksmith's Dream - Trespasses]]
