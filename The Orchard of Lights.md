# An Intensity of Radiance
> 'The invisible arts,' [[Christopher Illopoly]] is said to have remarked, 'are as profitable as macramÃ©, as ethical as tobacco-smuggling, and in general as beneficial as roulette. Still, there is always the Orchard of Lights.' And indeed, the Orchard, with its glowing fruit and its peaceful mists, is a place to be yearned for. Last night I walked there in the peaceful hours of the deep night. Even after waking, I still carry with me a little of the glory of [[the Sun-in-Splendour|the old Sun]].

# Glimmering
> The Sun-in-Splendour, the Hour who once ruled the Mansus, was known to walk in the Orchard, before his terrible division. Sometimes his remnants walk here still - sometimes I see the chilly radiance of [[the Meniscate]] through the trees, or the chillier radiance of [[the Sun-in-Rags]]. Were they to come upon me, it might be my end, but to see them in the distance is a gift of insight.

# Pulsing Airs
> The Hours have been called unmerciful, but they permit sleepers, sometimes, to walk in the Orchard of Lights, where each fruit glows like a sunset, where the roots of the trees are shaped for peaceful rest, where the mist soothes the heart. I was there last night, and the taste of the fruit lingers, sharp and sweet as the passage of spring to summer.

# A Forgotten Chronicle
> Last night I walked in the Orchard of Lights. I plucked the fruit (which is always ripe) and consumed it in two bites (the taste is not to be forgotten). As I licked the glowing juices from my fingers, I saw a message carved in the bark of the tree. When I woke, I recorded that message - all I could remember - in my diary.
