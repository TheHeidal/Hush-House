Someone has unhelpfully placed a curse which may tear open the unwilling eye of the soul. \[This contamination can affect your [[Fet]] and [[Phost]]. You can remove it with a skill that's effective against Curses, and at least 7 Heart.]

> 'When the sun was always red and low, we needed all our eyes. Now, Glory enters mercilessly if we open them unwisely.'
