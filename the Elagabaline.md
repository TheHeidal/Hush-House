The Elagabaline is a mysterious figure who might be any of [[Sunset Celia]] or [[Tryphon|Lady Tryphon]][^1]. She is likely named after the emperor [[Elagabalus]].

Older texts use 'the Elagabaline' as a title for [[Sunset Celia]][^2], and in [[Sunset Celia and the End of Days]] it is suggested she is Tryphon's sister.
