> By the beginning of the 20th century, an unwise Librarian's enthusiasms had brought Hush House to penury. Nocturnal Branch - later the Suppression Bureau - stepped in to offer an arrangement. Hush House received funding, but submitted to yearly inspections, and also surrendered a portion of the Isle for the Branch's prison.

1896-1932[^1]
In 1896, [[Thirza Blake]] spent too much money and the [[Nocturnal Branch]] took over Hush House, starting the [[Nocturnal Period]].
