# Summary
> An apparently theoretical project proposed by 'Lionel' of [[the Society of the Noble Endeavour]] which might permit the imprisonment of a renegade Forge-Name. A very heavily revised edition of an earlier and even more controversial work.
# Reading
> The book was evidently revised some time after [[the War of the Roads|the Wars of the Roads]] had ended, but even then this kind of discussion would have been politically difficult.
# Read
> 'Lionel' suggests that the [[Disciplines of the Scar]] and [[Disciplines of the Hammer|Hammer]] together would be necessary to create such a prison - but that either on its own would serve to release its occupant.
