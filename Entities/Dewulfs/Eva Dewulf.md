> 'Not to be crossed, and not to be found'[^8]

The last of [[Dewulfs|the Dewulfs]] and 7th Baroness Brancrug, 1702 - ???. Eva was the daughter of [[Valentine Dewulf]]. After his death in 1721 and her brother [[Eales Dewulf]] was ruled unfit to inherit, Eva became baroness at only 19[^1].

In 1722, Eva was abandoned at the altar by [[Abraham Wheelock]], and she likely killed him and framed him for espionage in response[^2].
Eva Dewulf was beset by rumors and scandal.
She was known to be close to [[Franklin Bancroft]], beginning a relationship with him in 1751 (at age 49).
She bore a son[^3], [[Sebastian Dewulf]], who died 1759 in [[the Battle of Quiberon Bay]][^4][^5]. Additionally, she had a daughter by Bancroft, who is likely [[Abra Southey]].

Eva is believed to have drowned with her two infant granddaughters[^6][^7].
