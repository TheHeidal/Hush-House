Valentine Dewulf was a member of [[Dewulfs|the Dewulfs]] and the 6th Baron Brancrug, father of [[Eales Dewulf]] and [[Eva Dewulf]]. A noted lover of birds, he constructed [[the Gullscry Tower]] and died after falling from it[^1].

In his youth, Valentine was inclined to religion and known to have made a pilgrimage to [[Fermier Abbey]][^2]. After this visit, he began to have dreams of [[the Wheel]] and [[the Malachite|the Ring-Yew]]
# Bust
> [[Valentine Dewulf]], 6th Baron Brancrug, known for his eccentricities. 'IN THE SKY HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS', an inscription reads.
> In 1721, poor Valentine fell from the top of the Gullscry Tower. Perhaps it was his melancholia that killed him - there were no witnesses, and his body was not found for three days. His son, Eales, was in no fit shape to inherit; and so his daughter Eva became Baroness at the age of only nineteen.
