Hendrik Dewulf was the first of the Barons Brancrug. He was first a prince, then leader of a company of soldiers that patrolled [[the Bounds]], but was granted [[Brancrug Isle]].

# Soldiering
In 1527, he participated in a sack of Rome[^1].
# Baron of Brancrug
In 1536 or 1537, he was granted Brancrug Isle by [[Henry VIII|King Henry VII]][^2]. He suppressed a local rebellion and had some interaction with [[Red William]]; either William foretold a prophecy he didn't like and was castrated, or he kept William as a prophet.
# Bust
> [[Hendrik Dewulf]], 1st Baron Brancrug, known for his pious, merciless justice. Granted [[Brancrug Isle]] in 1536 after the dissolution of [[the Abbey|St Brandan's]].
> Dewulf had been a mercenary captain on the Continent, under the notorious [[Maarten van Rossum]]. He was a hard man in a hard time, but not a simple one. He left van Rossum's service after the sack of the Hague, apparently after a spiritual crisis; it is known that he was at one point in training as a priest.
