Maybe the same entity as [[St Januarius]]. Maybe not.

in [[The Locksmith's Dream - Stolen Reflections]], Teresa says he is frequently identified with [[the Watchman]], [[the Twins]], with [[the Mother of Ants|the Mother]], with [[the Forge of Days]], with [[the Meniscate]] and [[the Madrugad]].

[[The Raptures of Forculus]] suggests that he is not an Hour. It is possible he is, but is denied by [[The Church of the Unconquered Sun]].

[[Unhatched Hymns]] suggests he is brother to [[the Meniscate]]

[[The Three and the Three (St Chiavi Manuscript)]] says Janus elects [[Calyptra]] and [[the Chancel]] is the judgement of Janus.
# Names:
- [[Forculus]]
- possibly [[St Januarius]]
