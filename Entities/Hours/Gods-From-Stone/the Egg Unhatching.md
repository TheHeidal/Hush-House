One of the [[gods-from-stone]] and the oldest hour[^2].. The Egg Unhatching is frequently described as a red, gentler sun who preceded the [[the Sun-in-Splendour]]. It took blood sacrifices[^3].

The Egg Unhatching 'fled' during the lithomachy[^1].

Its return is one of the possible ways [[the Second Dawn]] could come about.
