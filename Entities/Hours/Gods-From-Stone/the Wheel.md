The Wheel was a [[gods-from-stone|god-from-stone]], killed by [[the Moth]] 'usurping it from within and stealing its skin'[^1]. It still turns in [[the House of the Moon]].

The Wheel ruled from [[The Temple of the Wheel]].

It ruled a principle that preceded [[Heart]], altho I forget my citation for that #needs_citation
