# Names:
- [[Teresa Galmier|The Baldomerian]]
- [[Sunset Celia]][^2]

# Lingering Questions:
- Where does the unwise mortal come up?
- What does it mean "The watchman goes before, none but seven go after"[^4]? It is said that Sunset Celia walks after him[^5], are the Seven his Names?
- Does the Watchman have a connection to the [[the Egg Unhatching]], or is Omar off his rocker[^3]?
