A pair of Hours, the Sister-and-Witch and Witch-and-Sister, [[gods-from-blood]] who dwell in [[the Wood]] and [[the House of the Moon]]. They are members of [[the Roost]], where they manifest as kites[^10].

The Twins are notably associated with weaving; the language [[Fucine]], [[Lake Fucino]], and witches; coral, amber, and pearl; and shells.
# History
The Twins originated as the Witch[^6] and the Sister[^6] or Princess[^7]. They are agreed to have originated in the west[^7], possibly in Mexico[^6]. They drowned at sea and arrived in [[the Mansus]] via [[the Painted River]]. In the Mansus, they served [[the Red Grail]] for some time until the Grail felt threatened by them[^4].
# Servants
The Twins share the members of [[the Ligeian Club]] as their Names[^1][^8].

After crossing the sea the Twins first arrived at [[Brancrug Isle]] [^5].

# The Sister-and-Witch
The Sister-and-Witch is the 18th Hour, the Moon. She is an hour of Moth, Heart, and Grail[^8].
She is Cruciate, and sits on [[the Chancel]][^3], where she is sometimes known as Shell[^9].
Sometimes, the Mare is the Sister. This can be seen in them both being associated with dissolution[^11].
# The Witch-and-Sister
the Witch-and-Sister is the 6th hour, the Lovers. She is an hour of Grail, Heart, and Moth[^8].
She is *not* Cruciate.
The Sister-and-Witch may be petitioned for Numa with 20 Moon.
