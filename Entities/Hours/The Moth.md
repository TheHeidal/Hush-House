A [[Moth (principle)|Moth]]-Hour associated with [[the Wood]]. It embodies the principle of [[Moth (principle)|Moth]], and 
The Moth is incredibly old. It remembers a time when the Wood was bright[^1], and predates the Watchman bringing light[^3].
A [[gods-from-blood|god-from-blood]], which usurped [[the Wheel]][^2].

# Connection to the Chandler
There is one. #incomplete 

# Connection to the Thritige-Kind
The Moth masterpiece says "In the forests of the first continent, our ancestors cursed themselves with their own god."[^4] Those ancestors are not necessarily human, they could be the Carapace Cross.
If the Carapace Cross created the Moth, it recalls the Birdsong commit of Hill and Hollow.
> And the first of the Carapace Cross were [[the Thritige-kind]], who sought [[the Monarch-at-the-Crossroads]] to rule them wisely and found him in themselves, who began as many and ended as one.
