An yet-to-exist Hour of [[Lantern]] and [[Moth (principle)|Moth]][^1]. An hour of [[The Wood]].
The Chandler is said to be the oldest Hour, due to being made from the oldest hour[^2]. Possibly he's going to eat [[the Moth]]?
It definitely has some connection to [[Wickel Inextinguishable]], who might be its Name.
