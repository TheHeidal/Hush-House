An Hour of [[The Wood]], also known as the Centipede, the laughingthrush[^2], the Thief of Sights[^3], and the Pilgrim. The Vagabond is an Hour of Moth, Secret Histories, and Rose.
She created [[the Painted River]][^4]. The Vagabond is banned from [[the Mansus]] for what she will do.

The Vagabond was a [[gods-from-flesh|god-from-flesh]] who originated in Miah[^4]. There, she was punished for creeping into the temple precinct.

She may have inspired the [[House of Lethe]][^1].

Is said by [[The Book of the Centipede]] to have reacted badly to something in [[Miah]]. 

She is one of the Hours petitioned to summon Numa.
> With the proper arts and signs - and the proper <i>encaustum terminale</i> - a Librarian of the House might find a way to attract the direct attention of an Hour. The Vagabond has no dominion over [[Numa]] - no Hour does - but she knows it better than most. Perhaps the season will follow her here.
