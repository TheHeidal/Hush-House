## An Audience
> Mme Matutine is what they call a [[the Ligeian Club|Ligeian]], which means she's something like a person who does something like eat people. But I've heard she has an acquaintance with [[the Nameless Name]] of the Velvet, 'in whose mists the defeated find solace.' That might be something I need.
