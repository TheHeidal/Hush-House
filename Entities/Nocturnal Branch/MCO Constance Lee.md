## [[The Affair of the Forgivable Debt]]
[[Suppression Bureau|the Bureau]] has no business that far from home. But the local [[the Duties|Duties]] have asked for our help.'

I have a theory about how this quarrel beganâ€¦ I'd like to look into it, Librarian.' 

Librarian... this [[the trade of years|trade of years]]. It's [[the Madrugad]] who keeps the tally, and the Madrugad who is invoked when [[Reckoners]] make the trade. I think, just possibly, the stupidest Reckoner in the history of stupidity has turned a profit by cheating the Madrugad. I don't know who's going to regret that most. I'd better get to [[Kaunas]].'

MCO Lee, greatly concerned that a Reckoner might somehow have found a way to cheat the Madrugad, left for Kaunas in a hurry.
