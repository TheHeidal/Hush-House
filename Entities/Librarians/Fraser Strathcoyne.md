Fraser Strathcoyne was Treasurer of the Curia and briefly the fourth [[The Curia#Librarians|Librarian]] of Hush House. Now he is a #visitor  to Hush House.

Strathcoyne is [[Christopher Illopoly]]'s adoptive father[^1].

Fraser likely has lineage from [[the Carapace Cross]], as he received dreams during [[The Affair of the Claw and the Clouds]]. His plaque says "who died not but passed within", similar to the inscription on [['St Melancthe' (bust)]], which is sometimes used to refer to the Cross (but in her case might be a reference to the Egg).
