1734-1797[^2]

First Librarian of Hush House. Liked his tobacco. Primarily concerned with [[Forge]], but also did [[Nyctodromy]].

A niche with a plaque: 'Who often purified, but was not often pure'

He was a member of the [[House of Lethe|Obliviates]][^1], and likely is the reason the Obliviates have vaults under Hush House. He created the schism between birds and worms.
