> 'Who brought a key long lost'.[^2]

Willem Harries was the sixth [[The Curia#Librarians|Librarian]] of the Curia of the Isle. He had been a Dutch Lutheran priest and missionary to the Dutch East Indies until he began to worship of [[the Mother of Ants]] (as St. Agnes of the Gate)[^1]. While Librarian of Hush House, he is known to have lived in the [[Violet Chamber]], where he built a shrine to St. Agnes[^5].

He won the position of Librarian by bringing the key to the Hidden Stair (which may be a fanciful name of saying he enabled access to the [[Caves]]). The key was not a tangible object[^1]. This suggests it might be one of [[the Keys of Dream]], as they are not physical[^3].

Harries is possibly the same person as [[Gervinus van Lauren]]. They both were involved in a wager (possibly with the [[Great Hooded Princes]])[^4]. The Great Hooded Princes have something like two selves. Is that relevant?

He provides the quote for [[Door & Wall]], talking about locks and keys.

# Speculations

Is "the key long lost" a reference to [[The Keys of Dream]], [[the House Key]], or the [[key of Night]]? [[Gervinus van Lauren]] has more of a connection to [[the House Key]].
