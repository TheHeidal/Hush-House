> 'Who returned to complete what he began.'[^3]

Gervinus van Lauren was the eleventh [[The Curia#Librarians|Librarian]] of Hush House.

Van Lauren once was [[Willem Harries]], and as Harries he made a wager with [[Great Hooded Princes|the Great Hooded Princes]] to 'solve seven riddles', with the seventh known to be [[Wickel Inextinguishable]][^1]. The other six are 'resolved'.

Wickel Inextinguishable is also the final pentiment required to return the [[gods-from-stone]][^2], suggesting that the seven riddles are the seven pentiments. If this is true, it is unclear what it means for a riddle to be resolved. Is it merely that a solution has been found?
