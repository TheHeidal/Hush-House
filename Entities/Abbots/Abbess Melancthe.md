An Abbess of [[St Brandan's Abbey|the Abbey-Church of St Brandan's]]. Her skull is currently stored in [['St Melancthe' (bust)|a bust]], which suggests that she did not become a Long. She lived before 1349, the dissolution of the Abbey's double foundation[^1].

Things she makes, such as [[A Descent of the Shell]] and [['As Above, So Below']], tend to be too bright to look at.
