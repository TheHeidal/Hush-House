A 17th century mystic[^3] and contemporary of [[Julian Coseley]], once his friend[^1] and then not[^2].
Hersault was a member of the [[Birds of a Feather]][^2], which may have led to his separation from Coseley.
He believed that [[Janus]] was 'all gods'[^4].

Dreaming with [[Dread]]
> I remember that Hersault wrote of this. I've levered up floor-boards, and wriggled down snugly. Now I am compressed beneath them like a hidden corpse. The air stinks of hot dust. My mouth is full of splinters. This time, I haven't learnt what I hoped to learn - whatever that was.
