An inn in [[Brancrug Village]].

| Summer | It is Summer; I am sitting on the bench outside the Sweet Bones, eating crumbly cheese in nettle wrappings and good black rye bread, soaking up the sun. |
| Autumn | It is Autumn when the leaves rustle. The silent landlady has served me apple pie with steamed cream in the window-nook.                                  |


In Numa:
> Uncanny Labours
> Afterwards I don't remember what work I performed, except in scents and sensations - leaf-mould, a rhythmic musical clicking like melodious castanets, soft blue flame like antique gaslight. And cold; I remember that where we went, it was cold.
