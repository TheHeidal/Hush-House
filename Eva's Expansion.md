# Solarium
> This room was once for the meditation of favoured visionaries. Here [[Abbess Matilda|Matilda]] prophesied the victory of the [[Iron King]] in [[the War of the Roads|the Wars of the Roads]], much as it would occur three hundred years later. (She got his name wrong, though.)

>  Glaring Room
>  This has long been a holy place, but now [[the Sun-in-Rags]] has withdrawn his peace from it, and the light here cannot be borne. In the day the sun's light dazzles, in the night the moon's light freezes. Only once a peace has been laid on the room will I be able to enter safely.
# Chapter House
> Here the monastic superiors would meet to manage the affairs of [[St Brandan's Abbey|St Brandan's]] and to resolve its disputes. Here in 1349, the last [[Trials of st Brandan's|trial]] of the last nuns of St Brandan's took place. Two were executed for the murder of [[Abbess Nonna]], supposedly with 'perversions of the healing arts'. Nonna was the last abbess of St Brandan's, and after the trial, the monastery never accepted female novices again. From the wide windows, the sea is always visible, beating on the rocks far below.

  > [[Abbess Nonna]], apothecary, scholar, dancer.
## Echoing Chamber
>This has long been a holy place, but the voices of the monks have outlasted their prayers. A surly muttering circles the room, picking up speed as it goes. Each time it passes me, it almost manages to articulate my name.
