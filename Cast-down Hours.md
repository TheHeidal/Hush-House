Three hours have been cast out of [[the Mansus]]. Likely candidates include:
# Snow
It's almost certainly [[Snow (Hour)|Snow]], a Winter nowhere-hour known to Julian Coseley[^2].
# Wave
The most likely candidate for wave is [[the Blackbone]], who is associated with the sea and, like snow, receives very little mention
# Wound
I have seen arguments that wound is giri-something, but have not seen any such evidence for myself.
