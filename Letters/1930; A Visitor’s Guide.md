[[Hush House]] – A Visitor’s Guide
by the [[Reverend Timothy MacDonald]]
(price fourpence)

Dear Visitor,

I would like to welcome you to Hush House, one of the unexpected treasures of our Cornish coast. I have set aside considerable time to research the thousand-and-a-half years of its history, and I am pleased to share the fruits of my researches with you.

The history of the House is complicated, and can be bewildering to the ‘uninitiated’! To ‘ease you in’, I have identified five distinct periods or ‘phases’ in Hush House’s history.

Access to Hush House is by appointment. Please inquire at the Rectory. I regret that tours are not possible at high tide, on Church holidays, or while the Moon is visible in the sky. All proceeds from the sale of this booklet, or donations to tours, will be donated to the St Rhonwen Trust for the Advancement of Education.

# DAWN PHASE
In the sixth century, [[the Abbey|the Abbey of the Black Dove]] – sometimes called also the Abbey of the White Crow – is established as a double foundation of monks and nuns, surprisingly common in those Dark Ages. 599 A.D. is traditionally celebrated as the date of the Abbey’s foundation, although I believe the island church of [[Our Lady Beneath (Room)]] – regrettably unsafe to visit due to flooding and subsidence – dates from the third century.

The Abbey was subject to Danish raids on at least two occasions in the ninth century, although the raiders are also recorded as mercenaries quartered here against the incursions of Egbert of Wessex. One raider apparently becomes a brother of the Abbey under the name Thomas, and later rises to become Abbot. [[Abbot Thomas]] evidently finds it difficult to leave his savage past behind, and dies in circumstances too violent for me to describe here. “Live by the sword, die by the sword”!

# SOLAR GOTHIC PHASE
--
The splendid Abbey Church we see today – St Brandans – dates from the eleventh century. [[the Watchman's Tower]] and its fortified gatehouse were built in wood as a protection against Saxon rebels after the Conquest. They were later rebuilt in stone, after the Abbey gave shelter to [[The Watchman's Tree (tree)|a tree]] brought from Normandy by the new [[Earl Brian|Earl of Cornwall]]. The tree is said to flower white, black and red in consecutive springs. Perhaps if you keep a sharp eye out, you can identify one of its descendants!

Its substantial expansion in the thirteenth century was funded by an endowment from [[Eva de Braose]], a noble lady of the Marches whose husband was hanged under undignified circumstances. The [[Eva's Expansion|Solarium and Chapter House]] date from this point. St Brandan’s is by now established as a centre of learning and healing, and no doubt they were of assistance to Lady de Braose in some manner.

[[The Long Tower|The Winter Tower]], later called the Long Tower, dates from 1322 – curiously, the same year as the collapse of the tower of [[Ely Cathedral]]. The Tower stands alone in the gardens, and is fortified to no obvious end. I have examined what remains of its frescoes and I believe it was built in dedication to [[the Madrugad|the Sun Before Dawn]], according to the pre-Reformation solar traditions.

[[the Barber's Tower|The Barber’s Tower]] was constructed in 1450 to house the healer [[Natan of Regensburg]] – as a sanctuary or perhaps a prison, since Natan is a learned but a Hebrew gentleman, and his people are regrettably unwelcome in the Kingdom of England at this time. [[the Crucible Tower]] dates from a little later. [[The fire of 1929]] has left this tower unsafe, and I recommend strongly against close inspection.

# BARONIAL PHASE
In 1537, as part of [[Henry VIII|King Henry]]’s reforms, [[John Tregonwell]] is appointed to investigate St Brandans. He uncovers evidence of indulgent, corrupt and scandalous behaviour. The monastery is dissolved and the isle of Brancrug granted to [[Hendrik Dewulf]], one of Tregonwell’s captains, formerly a [[Guelders mercenary]]. Dewulf is clearly an uneducated and violent man, and he suppresses a local rebellion with intemperate brutality. One story tells of [[Red William|a local oracle]] who places a curse on Dewulf in revenge: “There will be no seventh of his line.” Dewulf has the man dragged before him, tells him “There will be no second of yours,” and unmans the oracle with his own knife!!

Nevertheless, [[the Dewulfs]] grow more temperate over time. They treat the Abbey Church with respect, and their seat, Brancrug House, is the core of the other buildings that grace the Isle today. [[Thomas Dewulf]], the second Baron, is nicknamed Baron Silence by the poets and playwrights of London – this I believe may be the origin of the later Hush House ‘moniker’!

Thomas restores [[the Watchman's Tower]] and builds [[the Watchman's Tower#The Watchman's Tower - Observatory|an observatory]] there in 1576 – with some foresight, since [[the Great Comet]] passes in 1577. His son [[Giles Dewulf|Giles]] runs away with a Bristol girl, although he and his father are ultimately reconciled. The Bristol girl, named [[Hafren Waters]], has the pale hair and eyes notable in the later Dewulfs.

The third Baron, [[Walter Dewulf|Walter]], remodels much of the interior of Brancrug House. Many of his innovations have been lost beneath later work, but you can still admire the [[Grand Ascent]] that unites the House’s various levels. Walter supports [[King Charles]] in the [[Civil War]], but in 1648, Walter’s son [[Bryan Dewulf|Bryan]] is hanged for treason that same King’s men. Walter’s heart bursts with sorrow, and his son post mortem receives special dispensation to be buried with his father. You may see their gravestones to this day, just to the west of the church. 

In the 1650s, The fourth Baron, [[Musgrave Dewulf|Musgrave]], ‘the Lamb Dewulf’, [[Restoration of the Long Tower|restores the Winter Tower]] as a residence for [[Julian Coseley]], the scholar and antiquary, who assists with the cataloguing and expansion of the library. Musgrave’s son, [[Gideon Dewulf|Gideon]], is wickedly nicknamed ‘the Motley Baron’ for his odd and brindled appearance, and so the Motley Tower – once the Barber’s Tower – wins its name.

The sixth and last Baron is [[Valentine Dewulf|Valentine]], an eccentric gentleman who builds [[the Gullscry Tower]] to house his aviary-collection. When Valentine falls to his death from the tower top, his daughter Eva inherits the estate at the age of nineteen.

Educated visitors will already know the name of [[Eva Dewulf]], the Pale Lady, who cuts quite the ‘figure’ at court! Alas she is engaged to a rapscallion named [[Abraham Wheelock]], who abandons her at the altar. Eva returns to Brancrug to recover, and is not seen at court again. However three days after her departure, Wheelock’s body is found on the beach near Gravesend. His face is so badly pecked by birds that he is only identified by his belongings. These include a waxed pouch containing a letter addressed to Wheelock, whose contents seem to show he is a spy in the pay of the Austrians! I suspect the matter has been ‘over-egged’, but Lady Eva no doubt would have found it all something of a relief.

Lady Eva never marries. She opens her library and draws visitors from across Europe and beyond. Some of these visitors are selected by peculiar and exacting criteria to attend sophisticated feasts in her [[Hall of Division]]. Others are drawn by Lady Evan’s reputation for scholarship – including the notorious [[Franklin Bancroft]], whose deep friendship with Eva inspires wicked gossip.

# THE CURIA PHASE
--
In 1759 Lady Eva’s heir, [[Sebastian Dewulf|Captain Sebastian Dewulf]], is drowned in battle against the French at [[Quiberon Bay]]. Lady Eva comes to a tragic end, and the Dewulf line ends. Brancrug House is all but abandoned, and the caves beneath the island become a [[smugglers|smuggler]]’s haunt.

But in 1785, a group of scholars acquires the deed to the Dewulf estate, establishing ‘[[The Curia|the Curia of the Isle]]’ as an institution for the preservation of knowledge. [[Ambrose Westcott]], [[Kitty Mazarine]], [[Solomon Husher]] – all these names
