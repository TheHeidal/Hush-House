HOTEL STEFANIE
VIENNA

January 15th-ish, 1906

Dear [[Serena Blackwood|Serena]] -

Got your book. Pretty good condition, too. Bit blurred round the edges, but the little fellow's taken good care of it. Not what I expected, though, rum business all round. Tell you how it was.

Trail in Venice long cold, obviously. They still tell stories about old [[Hokobald (of Pocsind)|Hokobald]], say the place is cursed now, but it's mostly cursed with rising damp. Don't know how anyone lives there. Anyway, no trace, so I thought, all right, D., my girl, get your head down, get [[seventy-seven winks]], see if [[the Sage-Knight]]'s entertaining, he'll know what's what.

You're reading this and thinking, come on, D., you know better than that, Sage-Knight's a bit high in [[the Mansus]] to be talking to Raw Prophets, what? But here's the thing, Sage-Knight knows the odd [[Ivories|Ivory]], Ivories know the odd [[Thirstlies|Thirstly]], Thirstlies know [[Raw Prophet|Raw Prophets]]. So I'll put the word out.

Sage-Knight's in a helpful sort of mood, so we both have a cup of that wine of his and then another cup and then another cup and we get to gossiping. He's all right for a Name. Shame he doesn't keep proper port, even dream-port, but he's all right for a Name. And I wake up and I pop out for a dawn smoke and a bit of the old practice and when I get back inside there's an address written on the [[mirrors (theme)|mirror]]. Not bad for a Name at all.

Address is in [[Vienna]]. Now you know how I feel about Vienna, never quite comfy there since all that with [[the Ligelian Club|the Ligeian Club]], but I think, Serena's a good sort, owe her a favour or two, not so far on the train. Off I pop.

Vienna, two days on. Find the address, have a snout about, you know, see what's what. Nasty little den, full of the wrong sort of the wrong sort, and they've got their own little shrine for the Raw Prophet. (Sage-Knight gave me its name, I tried to write its name, won't fit in this alphabet. Let's call him [[Propsy]].) Little cult for Propsy. Now you know me, Serena, live and let live, all sorts, but a shrine to something like Propsy, I always thought it's like building a shrine to a lamb chop. You've seen Prophets, haven't you? They look like a horse stepped on a starfish. But bigger. But, dashed odd thingâ€¦ Propsy's not a bad sort. Can't talk, of course, but the little feller can write. And I don't just mean write like I'm writing this letter, express itself, put its point of view, sort of thing. I mean it's a calligrapher. Dashed good calligrapher. Every one of those little tentacle things, good as a Japanese paint-brush. Where does it get the ink, you're wondering, aren't you, Serena? Be glad I'm not telling you.

Long story short, Propsy reckons it wrote the '[[The History of Inks|History of Inks]]', reckons it was stolen, reckons all sorts of the worst about H.H. (Sorry, Serena.) So we had a good old chat, and I did knock it about a little bit, but we agreed in the end, and it gave me the book back, but it wanted paying. Seemed fair enough. And I've added a line to my bill for that. Bit of a sum, I'm afraid, try not to kick. Sure you won't, know you're a good sort.

So here you go, bill, book, all we're missing is a candle, ha ha! I'll be by again for the Equinox. Could use your help on a thing with [[the Mausoleum]]. And [[the Ligeian Club|the Club]], actually. Bit of a business, there.

Pip pip
[[Daymare|D.]]

PS! Propsy wants proper attribution. Name in the catalogue. Course, can't write its name here. Won't fit in this alphabet. Hope you can sort that out. Might cause a bit of a stink if not. Leave it with you. Best of luck. D.
