[[Superintendent Wynford]] -
Please consider this my Sequestration & Assessment Report for materials seized at [[Ortucchio]]. I am aware (you have reminded me on previous occasions) that Administration distributes forms that we are generally expected to use for these reports, but events since Ortucchio have made that impractical. Consequently I have allowed myself latitude in the format.

i. [[Skull]], deformed/abhuman. Abnormalities consistent with [[la malaise Raveline]], and the standard assessments suggested the expected oneiric risk. Destroyed (pulverisation and dilution).
ii. Three cases [[Domaine Raveline]], 1865 vintage. Standard assessments suggested no discernible oneiric hazard. Retained for sale and expenses recoup. (You generally feel compelled to remind me, Superintendent, of the regulations on implied hazard. In turn I generally feel compelled to remind you that I know what I'm doing.)
iii. Painting, oils, late nineteenth century, artist unknown. Moonlit view of snowy city. Contemporary label identifies it as [['Abydos Uncrowned (Painting)'|'Abydos Uncrowned']]. Standard assessments clearly indicated significant oneiric hazard. Destroyed (incineration).
iv. '[[Bancroft Diaries|Diaries of Lord Franklin Bancroft 1762-1770]]', 1889 Cater & Sons reprint. I am well aware that the Branch depository contains the mandated two copies of this edition and that I would normally be expected to consign it to the flames. However my good friend [[Dottore Robigo]] has
argued persuasively that they contain material important to my work here. Retained.
v. [[Muriabolic mirror]], composition unknown. Clear and immediate oneiric hazard. Destroyed (pulverisation in the absence of light, dilution).
vi. '[[A Child's Treasury of Golden Afternoons]]', [[Jacob Gristwood]]. Clearly I am aware of the Standing Incineration Order on this work but this may be the only copy still in existence and the [[Skolekosophy|skolekosophic]] resources available to the Branch are frankly embarrassing in their paucity. After a detailed examination, not to mention discussion with my very good friend the Dottore, I have determined that it is much too valuable to be destroyed. Retained.
vii.[[ Fantastical triptych]], oils,sixteenth century; prodigious enthroned mass adored by kneeling figures. Vibrant depiction of heterodox Christian harvest festival. Standard assessments (when suitably interpreted) indicate negligible oneiric hazard; and it was through this work that I made the acquaintance of my very good friend Dott. Robigo. Retained.
viii. [[the Silver Hand|Silver hand]], life-sized, inscription probably antique Persian. Standard assessments suggest minor oneiric hazard. However given this operation's urgent need for funds, I have determined that the scrap value of the piece outweighs its sale to the public. Retained for sale and expenses recoup.
ix. Three ten-year vital-extension bond documents ('[[Trade in Years|stolen decades]]') with [[Reckoners|Reckoner]] markings. The suspicious longevity of the Duffoures of Ortucchio, was, you recall, one of the concerns that justified this seizure operation. That longevity is neatly explained by a Reckoner connection and other documentary evidence (not material to an A&S Report) also supports this conclusion.
Despite recent developments (see below) I am inclined to forward this evidence to you as a professional courtesy. I have however resolved to retain the vital-extension bonds for my own use. My physical development proceeds admirably but I am approaching a critical stage at which I must take all necessary means to sustain my health. Retained for personal use (approved).
x. Desiccated organic material, probably amniotic membrane ('[[caul]]'). It certainly tastes like birth. Standard assessments indicate significant oneiric hazard; my invaluable friend Dott. Robigo has suggested a safer procedure than incineration. Incorporated into abdomen.

I have become impatient as I write, and in any case I have rarely known you to pay my reports the attention they deserve. This concludes my report. A personal note follows.

--

I now tender to you my immediate and vigorous resignation. On sombre reflection, Superintendent Wynford - I am appalled that I permitted myself to be involved for so long in the illegal operations of the British Government - in a sovereign and noble nation - in a myopic and ignoble cause - under the orders of a man as minimal and sluggish as yourself.

I have expropriated the funds originally provided for Nocturnal Branch operations in Italy. With the assistance of the provincial authorities (and of course of dear [[Dottore Robigo]]) I am using those funds to endow a Skolekosophy Department at the [[Universit√† Velletri]] - though the Dottore and I have resolved that to minimise troublesome interference we will operate publicly as a Department of Mycology. Now that I am free of your pettifogging and pious interference, I intend to expand both physically and mentally to the fullest possible extent.

I hope that in light of the information I have chosen to share here, you will reconsider the static and sterile mode in which you have so long developed, and address yourself instead to the possibilities of a more growth-oriented philosophy. Should you need my assistance in this alteration, you are welcome to visit my new Department in Velletri, where I, and my most
excellent friend Dottore Robigo, will tender you our most urgent and productive assistance.

Yours,
\[indecipherable smear]

Afterword:
At the turn of the century, the [[Nocturnal Branch]] of the Metropolitan Police was responsible for protection against 'troubles unseemly and occult.' After the fallout from the Ortucchio Incident, the Branch was dismantled and its functions absorbed into the civilian [[the Suppression Bureau|Suppression Bureau]]
