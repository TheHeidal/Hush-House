[[The Curia|OFFICE OF THE CURIA]]
[[Hush House]], [[Brancrug Isle|Brancrug]]

June 22nd, 1924

[[Detective-Ostiary Pender]] -

Thank you for your time last week, and for your patience. I’ve reviewed your requests for limitation. Most are acceptable to the Curia. Some are not. In this letter, I’ve outlined our objections. I hope that we can find common ground, and an acceptable compromise.

*[[Nix Abolix.]]* You marked as 'Suppress'. No arguments here. Quite frankly, I don't know how it ever made it to the main collection. We don't need any more [[Worms]] in the world. I mention this only to say that we do, despite our differences, appreciate the Bureau's efforts and contributions.

On the other hand, *[[My Most Violent Enterprise]]*. You marked as 'Restrict'. That's a little extreme. I really don't think it merits even an 'Advise'. The contents are certainly pretty despicable, but if *Enterprise* is 'Advise', we are going to have to revise classification for a great many other equally despicable items. The function of Hush House is not to protect, but to preserve.

*[[An Almanac of Entrances|The Almanac of Entrances]]*. You marked as 'Suppress'. I can see the risks, but I don't believe suppression is merited. We'll agree to 'Restrict'.

*[[OGHKOR OGHKOR TISSILAK OGHKOR]]*. You marked 'Restrict'. I understand your concerns, but [[the Excellency Gnathobasis|the author]] has not been witnessed abroad in the world for at least two centuries, and can reasonably be considered defunct. I'll allow 'Advise', and we'll revise to 'Restrict' if the author is ever verifiably reported active again.

*[[A Child's Treasury of Golden Afternoons]]*. You marked as 'Expunge.' This is a proposal we would consider only in the most extreme circumstances. The text is already categorised 'Contain'. I've discussed with the Librarian and we are confident that the theoplasmic contamination - which is, I grant, quite advanced - can be purged. If it can't, then we will consider the 'Expunge'.

*[[Codex Acephali]]*. You marked as 'Contain'. I agree that this is a reasonable request, and once again, I wanted to thank you for drawing it to our attention. As a matter of fact, the contamination has also reached the neighbouring texts (*[[The Radical Measure]]* and *[[In the Malleary]]*) and we're going to mark those 'Contain' too, pending review.

*[[The History of Inks]]*. You marked as 'Suppress'. Now this is not the first nor indeed the second time that the [[Suppression Bureau]] has taken issue with this book, and I do see your point, some of the inks are extremely significant, but with all due respect, Hush House has its purpose, as you must know, and the Suppression Bureau's place is not to question that purpose. Your Suppression request is denied. My patience is wearing thin. If I see another such request for the History in future years, I'll take up the matter with our patrons.

*[[The Kerisham Portolan]]*. 'Suppress.' I don't think so.

*[[Blackwood's Magazine, January 1922]]*. 'Restrict.' I assume this is some sort of joke. I must assure you that no-one in the Curia is laughing.

Yours sincerely,
