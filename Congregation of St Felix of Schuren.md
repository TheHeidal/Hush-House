>A nonconformist enclave of a heterodox sect of a calvinist offshoot, tuck away in an odd corner of the city. They belt out hymns with unsuitable gusto, in a throat-scraping language that is very much not quite Latin.

A vault. Guarded by [[Monks]], who can be defeated with Edge or Moth.
## Beginning an Expedition
> Membership of the Congregation is strictly controlled. It may even be inherited. The safest approach is to burgle the minister's residence while he's conducting a service - but the sworn mothers of the Congregation guard the place in shifts, and they are not easily distracted.
## Secret Devotions
> The minister's bed-chamber is grand in proportion, but sparsely funished. Beneath the window, a feathered ornamental axe rests beside an enameled chalice-drum on a little altar of yew-wood.

Those are symbols of the three Hours of [[the Triple Knot]].

# Loot
> Beneath the altar, in a box secured with a complicated triple knot, we find a trove of books - and more besides - a knife rank wiht old blood, a twist of cloth, a leathery remnant of something the minister must have surrendered at his ordination.
