| Heart     | Horned-Axe, Oldest | [[The Horned-Axe]] bears two blades; permits passage when passage is to be permitted; waits at the threshold. The Horned-Axe, who forbids contradiction, is the oldest Hour. Other Hours might seem older. They are not older. | Oldest | Heart, Knock  |
| Moth      | Moth, Oldest       | [[The Moth]] beats within the skull; seeks among the trees of the Wood; is dappled. The Moth, who delights in contradiction, is the oldest Hour that remains. Any that seem older, the Moth once was, when once it was.        | Oldest | Moth, Lantern |
| Grail     | Grail, Oldest      | [[The Red Grail]] gives life; the Grail takes life; the Grail is not sated. The Grail, who disdains contradiction, is the oldest Hour that persists. Any that seem older are subsumed, eventually, in the Grail's tides.       | Oldest | Grail, Nectar |
# First Flower
| Principle | Name | Text | Type | Gives |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Moon | Black, the First Flower | [[The Watchman's Tree]] is the covenant that forbids knowledge to mortals, but permits it in the covenant-houses of the Tree... like Brancrug Isle. [[Calyptra\|The Black Flower of Calyptra]] -'the night unwounded' - was its first defence. Forbidden knowledge must not be spoken; must not be written; must not be known. The Tree is rooted in night. | First Flower | Moon, Scale |
| Forge | Red, the First Flower | [[The Watchman's Tree]] is the covenant that forbids knowledge to mortals, but permits it in the covenant-houses of the Tree... like Brancrug Isle. The Red Flower of Calyptra -'the fire fuelled by truth' was its first defence. Fire consumes knowledge... but fire also gives light. The Tree is rooted in paradox. | First Flower | Forge, Rose |
| Winter | White, the First Flower | The Watchman's Tree is the covenant that forbids knowledge to mortals, but permits it in the covenant-houses of the Tree... like Brancrug Isle.The White Flower of Calyptra -'the silence that is given' was its first defence. When forbidden knowledge is known, it must be forgotten. But to be forgotten, it must first be known. The Tree is rooted in paradox. | First Flower | Winter, Edge |

| Edge | Speech, the Sword | Language is a weapon. With language, we breached the Mansus; without language, we could not have fought wars; without language, we would still be apes, beetles, stone. | Speech | Edge, Grail |
| Rose | Speech, the Key | Language is the key. It was language that opened the doors of the Mansus; without language, we could have had no peace; without language, we would still be beasts, worms, mud. | Speech | Rose, Sky |
| Knock | Speech, the Wound | Language is a scar. It was language that tore open the Mansus; without language, we could have had no wars; without language, we would still be fire, sky, earth. | Speech | Knock, Winter |

| Lantern   | Glorious Origin     | Our first sparks of self descended from the light above the world which we call the Glory. Without the Glory, we would be beasts in darkness, and the gifts of our past illuminate our future, which is Eternity          | Lantern, Moth |
| Sky       | From-Nowhere Origin | [[The Thritige-kind]] of the Carapace Cross dreamed themselves out of black glass, to be their own Monarch. If we inherit the empty throne, we dream ourselves into every night to come.                                  | Sky, Forge    |
| Nectar    | Roots Origin        | Our ancestors were born naked in the roots of the Wood. All we ever were has risen from that darkness. With our hands and our mouths we shaped language from mud. With our mouths and our hands we will shape our future. | Nectar, Moon  |
| Scale     | Shell Origin        | The Carapace Cross are a hybrid race, and once we were the Carapace Cross. From [[the Seglaz-kind]], we inherited what now we call language. We long for what we were; and History too is hybrid.                         | Scale, Heart  |
