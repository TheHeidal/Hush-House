| **Winds of Noon**<br><br>"<i>This History is my last and greatest work. That old lost music will draw the Birds, the Names, the architects and the adepts to Noon across the evening sea. </i><br><br>'Noon, they say, is not as it was.' But Noon, with its towers of ivory, its wheels of shining iron, is becoming something more.                                                                                                                                                               | **The Last City, Noon**<br><br>"<i>This History is my last and greatest work. This will be the last city on Earth. When it passes, so will the world.</i><br><br>Across the evening sea. Ever since the Spring of the Witness rose from the earth, Port Noon has been a place for the ones who defy endings. Now, as the ivory towers rise, it's a place for those who accept them. In the end, that'll be all of us.                                                             | **Advent at Noon**<br><br>"<i>This History is my last and greatest work. When the Carapace-kind return, they will return to Noon. </i><br><br>Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes.  Now, as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, Noon is different; for good, or for ill, but not forever.                                                                                                                    |
| **Songs at Noon (Symurgist)**<br><br>"<i>My songs await me. That old lost music will draw the Birds, the Names, the architects and the adepts to Noon across the evening sea.<br><br>Across the evening sea to Noon - for so long a city of Long, and now a city of song. Each day the ivory towers rise a little higher. 'Noon, they say, is not as it was.' But now we hear on the wind what Noon could become. I have found that old lost music… and the Hours of the Roost take up the refrain. | **Silence at Noon (Magnate)**<br><br>"<i>I've found my peace. This will be the last city on Earth. When it passes, so will the world.</i><br><br>'The houses are white and the hills are green and the air is golden and the sea won’t settle on one colour….' That's still true. But all the colours grow pale. The towers of ivory will rise higher day by day. One day, they'll be complete. Until then, I'll know peace; and when they're complete, it won't matter any more. | **Revolutions at Noon (Revolutionary)**<br><br>"<i>Here are the sparks of revolution. When the Carapace-kind return, they will return to Noon. </i><br><br>Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes. The residents took a while to come around to it. But Noon has always been a place outside the rule of the Hours, before all else;  as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, it can become a place of defiance. |
| **Peace at Noon (Magnate)**<br><br>"<i>I've found my peace. That old lost music will draw the Birds, the Names, the architects and the adepts to Noon across the evening sea. </i><br><br>Port Noon, across the evening sea. It's long been a place for Long, and now it's something more. Each day more of us arrive. The waves take our name as once the fountain did. The towers rise day by day. Here in the City's shade, there will be peace.                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Sanctuary at Noon (Executioner)**<br><br>"<i>We'll bring them back. And when the Carapace-kind return, they will return to Noon. </i><br><br>Across the evening sea. The day the Cross came, the sky above Port Noon was dark with returning wings, and the sea boiled with their shapes. The residents took a while to come around to it. But Noon has always been a sanctuary before all else; and now, as the Carapace-spires of horn and ivory rise above the new City, it's a sanctuary for them, too.                                   |

| **The Republic of Solitude**<br><br>"<i>This History is my last and greatest work.

Let Eternity tremble!               | **The Sanctuary Never (Twiceborn)**<br><br>"<i>I've found a place of safety, in a city that will never be built - a fortress of paradox.</i><br><br>By day I walk in the world, by night in the Mansus, but wherever I go, I walk the streets of the City Never. I am a servant of its laws, a subject of its kingless throne. The laws of others cannot touch me; and I am not alone. | **A City of Shadows (Executioner)**<br><br>"<i>The Sun's light cannot drive out the last friendly shadows.

| <i>January 9th, 1838. A heavy snow falls on Brancrug. When the staff dig themselves out, Solomon Husher, third Librarian of the House, has disappeared from his quarters in the Long Tower, leaving a letter of resignation. 'Winter,' the letter concludes, 'does not wait forever; though Janus might.' Husher is never seen again, but every year on the same day, his footprints can be found beneath the Tree.</i><br><br>After the red leaf and the gold have gone,<br>Brought down by the wind, then by hammering rain...<br>...I speak to you now with the land's voice,<br>It is the cold, wild land that says to you<br>A knowledge glimmers in the sleep of things:<br>The old hills hunch before the north wind blows.<br><br>Howard Nemerov, 1920-1991, from <i>'A Spell Before Winter'</i>. | "<i>Hush House lives again. Perhaps that's all I want. Some of the very best Librarians have worked well, lived quietly, left the world a better place...</i><br><br>I have my fire, my books, my clock, my window on the world where they do other things; and I am happy. This is the life I chose. The years will pass, like sun, like snow, like rain, like a gull's wing beating, and when I close my eyes, they will find me smiling. |
