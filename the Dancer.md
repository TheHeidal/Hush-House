# Work at the Ecdysis Club

# Sendings
## Fox
Sulochana sends the Dancer to the [[Foxlily Meadows]], where they learn from [[Karpellus]].
## Eagle
### Heart
Sulochana sends the dancer to [[Miah]], telling them that if [[the Vagabond|the Thief of Sights]] asks after her, to give her regards to [[Kleidouchos|Kleido]]... on second thought, perhaps not.[^1]
Once there, the dancer dances with [[the Vagabond]].
### Sight, Surrendered (Heart)
> I have given my eyes to the Vagabond, and through them I shall see what she would see: the road to the red change.

## Wolf
### Moth
The Dancer sends their wolf-sending to [[Port Noon]]. There it sleeps at the memorial to [[Coelle|Coelle the flower-girl]], and in its sleep [[the Wolf-Divided]] comes to thrill them with its hatred. They surrender their bones. (Moth)
### Bones Surrendered (Moth)
> the Sun was divided and the Wolf will not let me forget the salt savour of its bones - not until the Mansus cracks. Now the wolf requires that I carry that savour through the door in the wood.
# The Last Dance
## Heart
> On the very rare occasions that Mr Agdistis speaks, his voice is very beautiful - a mellow sound like an alto flute. 'You almost have what you need,' he says, 'to pass [[the Kingskin Gate]]. One will come to lend you the key.' He looks you in the eye. 'I beg you not to take her hand, not to look upon her feet, and not to offer her to drink.' He begins, very softly, to weep. 'It will hurt. I love her.'
## Moth
> Sulochana is there for my last performance. 'Almost there. I don't hold the key for the door you must pass. But [[Medusa|my sister]], who is the oldest of our kind still living (not that she's alive) - my sister will bring it to you in dream. I tell you this as a favour to you and to her: do not look upon her face.' She lights a cigarette. 'It'll hurt,' she adds, with some amusement.
> 
> 'When the dance is done, when my mind is mazed and stumbling, when my emotions rear like serpents, I cannot easily tell what is real, any more. Sulochana is real, I think. My reflection in the mirror - the reflection of a hind - that is very real. 'Go quickly,' Sulochana says. She clasps my shoulder, and kisses me on the mouth, softly as a moth-wing. Her lips are cold. Her breath is carrion. Her eyes are lovely night. Is that real?
### Guise:
## Moth and Heart
> Sulochana and Mr Agdistis are both there for my last performance. 'Almost there,' she says. She frowns. 'I'm not certain... well, you're committed now. Good luck in the Wood, I suppose.' She lights a cigarette. 'It'll hurt,' she adds, with some amusement. Behind her, Mr Agdistis says your name, once, softly. His voice is very beautiful - a mellow sound like an alto flute.

### Guise: Imago
> My spirit will leave my body as a great horned beast. To be a sacrifice? [What is within, without; what is without, within.]
