# The Name of the Serpent:
My serpent-self has found the old dream where the Name of [[the Mother of Ants]], called [[Old Mother Anguish]], met with her daughter [[Daha]], who had a twin. Their parley is long ended but I can still learn their lesson.

## Integument, Surrendered:
The Twins and the Serpent war, and in that war I have learned how pain can be a gate.
