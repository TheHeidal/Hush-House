> [[Robert Fermier]] spent much of his unsavoury fortune on the endowment of this monumental, forest-crowded abbey. The monks dislike visitors. Their ways are not exactly orthodox. They celebrate a certain harvest festival with unsavoury vigour.

Fermier abbey is a vault on [[the Continent]]. It is suggested that the monks there oppose [[the Red Grail]].

## Beginning an Expedition: Fermier Abbey
> Fermier Abbey, folded into the forest like a jewel-box smuggled in a green robe. If we can make it through the forest, we'll still have to face the monks. 
## Beneath the Boughs
> The monks and their miseries lie behind us. Here in their chapel-courtyard, a great yew rises beside a granite altar, lidded like a sarcophagus. What's within?
> The space inside the altar is filled with broken cups, every one painted red, every one scrawled with vile graffiti and otherwise befouled. The monks must have held great ceremonies of detestation, and kept the remains as trophies. Buried among the cup-corpses are other treasures.
