> A long hunting knife, or a short close-quarters sword. A plaque reads '[[Hendrik Dewulf]], 1525'
> If the blade is real and the date correct, Hendrik must have borne this weapon during his time on the Continent, long before he ever became first Baron Brancrugâ€¦ perhaps even in [[Guelders Wars|the 1527 Sack of Rome]], which apparently provoked his spiritual crisis and brought him, eventually, to Brancrug.
