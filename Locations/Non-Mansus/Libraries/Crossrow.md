> In a garden city of the far West, in an establishment of uncertain age, in a gloriously decaying garden-mansion, you can find perhaps the only library in the world where silence is discouraged. The Watchman and the Vagabond are venerated there, and Sunset Celia's shrine is aligned each day so the dawn may be greeted with music. It claims to be the site of the first Roost, though it's by no means the only place to make that claim. The lights of the house are never extinguished, and its hospitalities, if you can find the place at all, are generally both warm and bright. Perhaps we'll see you there.
