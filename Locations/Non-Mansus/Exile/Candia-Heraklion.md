> A hard two decades. The Asia Minor Disaster; independence, and the Union with Greece; and then a monkey bit the King to death. But the Cretans and their island have endured four thousand years, and they endure still. The harbour is mountainous with fortifications, but Heraklion lies quiet in the afternoon sun.

# Arrival
> On the night before I arrive in Crete, I dreamt about gods underground. When I woke, I went up on deck. The stars blazed relentlessly, as if holes had been pierced in the night above. The night was clear; the horizon scalpel-sharp. A woman's voice behind me spoke a crackling word I didn't recognise. When I turned, I saw she only had half a face, and the other half was scaled like a butterfly's wing. Then I woke truly, alone in the hot iron dark of my cabin.
