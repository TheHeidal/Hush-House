> This year in teh City of Lights, the socialists battle the communists, the Metro grumbles, gaunt artists prowl bookshelfs on the Other Bank. Plus ca change.
# Destination
> [[Tante Adeline]]'s moved on, but she still has people in Paris, and they'll give me shelter.

# Arrival
> Tante Adeline's man is a surly, lanky fellow in a leather apron. He doesn't speak to me at all - just sits there feeding gobbets of raw meat to his dogs - but he listens as I explain, and he motions to a huge Corsican to follow me when I leave.
