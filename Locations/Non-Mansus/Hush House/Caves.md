The caves beneath Hush House were once inhabited by 
# Stairs
## Hidden Stair
> After [[Natalia Brulleau|Brulleau]]'s retirement in 1861, the Curia found itself short of promising candidates - until the arrival of [[Willem Harries]], a former Dutch Lutheran priest and a sometime correspondent of [[Fr. Stanislav John Schaller|Stanislav Schaller]]. He had been a missionary in the Dutch East Indies until his faith was lost or transmuted into a devotion to St Agnes of the Gate, and he was drawn to Hush House.
> He won his position by presenting the Curia with a 'key long lost'. That was the key to this very stair, but only the naive would assume the key was a tangible object.
### Rustling Stair
> Serpent-scales whisper on stone; serpent-eyes glitter in the pale window-light.
## Whispering Stair
> This was the stair that the priestesses walked, in the time that this was the Abbey of the Black Dove. Their carved faces still guard the walls. Their prayers may still be heard when the airs of the Isle are exceptionally still.
### Riddling Stair
> Half-seen faces mouth half-heard riddles. This is none of van Lauren's work - these defences are much older than the Curia. But the Curia found a way to answer these riddles, and so will we.

# Caves of the Sisterhood
## Narthex
> If you were a pilgrim to the Abbey of the White Crow, you'd purify yourself here. You didn't want to track profane Dumnonian mud or alien Mare Britannicum salt into the holy precincts. Or unclean thoughts. Especially not unclean thoughts. The priestesses here were a little more merciful than the Hours they served, but only a little.
### Slithering Fountain
> After all these years, the fountain in this hall is blocked. That's not a surprise. A little more surprising is this: the blockage appears to be mostly snakes; a great many snakes. This, no doubt, is why we have seen so few rats.
