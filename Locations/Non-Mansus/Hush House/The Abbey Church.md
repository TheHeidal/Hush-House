# Nave of the Abbey Church
> For a thousand years [[the Unconquered Sun]] has been worshipped here in all his Aspects - though since the heresies of [[the Intercalate]], many of those aspects are considered distinct Hours in their own right, and the Sun's death and birth are both now celebrated. The Abbey Church used to be more golden, but many of the valuables were lost at the Abbey's dissolution, including the original stained glass. These magnificent windows are of recent manufacture, financed by the eighth Librarian, [[Sir David Greene|Greene]], who was a believer of [[the Second Dawn]] variety.
## Solar Altar
> [[The Sun-in-Splendour]] is the Hour which was sundered; the Hour which is not conquered; the Hour from which proceed all the other Hours of the day. Or so the Church teaches.
## Stained Glass Windows

| Window              | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [[The Watchman]]    | THE WAY IS LIT FOR THE WILLING AND FOR THE UNWILLING |
| [[the Meniscate]]   | WHAT IS WITHIN, WITHOUT; WHAT IS WITHOUT, WITHIN     |
| [[The Madrugad]]    | WHATEVER IS NOT NECESSARY SHALL BE QUENCHED.         |
| [[the Sun-in-Rags]] | WHEN IT ENDS, IT WILL BE A BEAUTIFUL ENDING          |
# Atrium
> In 1651, [[Musgrave Dewulf]] endowed the atrium with a shrine to [[St Januarius|St Januarius of the Gate]]. Musgrave was a pious man but also a Puritan, so this grand shrine was a little unusual. St Januarius is also an unusual choice - but he is the patron saint of boundaries, and the [[Dewulfs]] were often said in some sense to be 'Marcher Lords' charged with the keeping of boundaries.
## Shrine: St Januarius
> [[St Januarius]] is the Name which was wounded; the Name of exceptions; the little god at the door.
# Glorious Stair
> Each stair tread is decorated with a quotation from [[the Book of Suns]], so that the congregation might be edified as they ascend. The quotes are worn to half-legibility by the passage of all those worshipful feet, which may be why some of these quotations differ troublingly from any orthodox version. It has of course been claimed that [[the Sisterhood of the Knot]], who first held the Isle, also held a copy of the long-suppressed [[Shuritic Book of Suns|Shuritic version of the Book]]....
## Shrine: the Madrugad
> [[The Madrugad]] is the Hour which cannot be unbalanced; which quells and quiets; which comes before the sun
# Radiant Stair
> The Watchman's shrine here is decorated with the [[Eye Elagabaline]] - a controversial variant of the [[Watchman's Eye]]. The [[Elagabaline rites]] have always had a shaky doctrinal status. It would not often have been seen, of course. These stairs were reserved for the choir monks who sang the liturgy of the Hours, the only ones permitted to enter the Chancel. Still, it is a little surprising that the Eye was allowed to remain, when the monastery was dissolved and the Isle given to the Dewulfs.
### Shrouded Stair
>This has long been a holy place, but the Meniscate has withdrawn her favour now. Someone has shattered a mirror on the floor. The shards wink from the gloom - something half-seen flits from shard to shard, avoiding my gaze, unseen no matter how quickly I turn my head. Only once it's pacified will I be able to pass safely.
## Shrine: the Watchman
> [[The Watchman]] is the Hour which navigates; which illuminates; which is not compassionate

# Chancel of the Abbey Church
> [[The Church of the Unconquered Sun|The Church of the Unconquered Sun]] acknowledges only a handful of Hours: [[the Sun-in-Rags|the Sun in Rags]] or [[the Sun-in-Splendour|Splendour]]; [[the Meniscate]]; [[the Madrugad]]; [[the Watchman]]; and, reluctantly, [[the Wolf-Divided]]. Any other so-called 'Hours' must be lesser powers, wicked impostors, or superstitions.
> So the Church denies two of the three Hours of [[the Chancel]]. And yet it's the Chancel who are said to determine which of their peers qualify as Hours. That's theology for you.
> [[Abbot Geffrey]] decreed that all three should be venerated in this holiest of rooms. To avoid actual heresy, he would not permit any of the three to be named. That's theology, too.

### Veiled Chamber
>This has long been a very holy place - too holy to be left untended safely for this long. There are seventy-seven candles, and each one burns with a chill blue flame, each flame inhabited by a watchful spirit. I should not enter until each flame has been cleansed or extinguished.
## Shrine: The Chancel
> We do not name these Hours, but we acknowledge that together they are [[the Chancel]], [[the Chancel|the Cruciate]], and [[the Chancel|the Rode]].

Using [[Sickle & Eclipse]] or [[Sacra Limiae]] on the shrine reveals [[The Sun Disfigured]].

# Windlit Gallery
> In the days of the brethren, every day this gallery would ring with [[the Liturgy of the Hours]]. In the times of [[Dewulfs|the Dewulfs]] and of [[the Curia]], there were services here every Sunday. All those times are long gone. This is a house of echoes now.
## Instrument: Hunter's Harp
>This was once strung with [[the Yeth|yeth-hound]] gut. Those strings must be long gone, but there's still an unusual savagery to the harp's notes.
## Windlit Workbench
> Labour quietly.
## Contents
- [[HMS Kerisham]]
# Eva's Expansion
In the thirteenth century[^1], [[Eva de Braose]], 'the first Eva', gave a substantial donation to the [[the Abbey]] as payment for the nuns framing her husband for adultery[^2].
## Solarium
> This room was once for the meditation of favoured visionaries. Here [[Abbess Matilda|Matilda]] prophesied the victory of the [[Iron King]] in [[the War of the Roads|the Wars of the Roads]], much as it would occur three hundred years later. (She got his name wrong, though.)
### Contents
- The bust of [[Willem Harries#Bust|Willem Harries]]
- [[Ninewink Clock]]
- [[Sol Invictis Symbol]]
### Glaring Room
>  This has long been a holy place, but now [[the Sun-in-Rags]] has withdrawn his peace from it, and the light here cannot be borne. In the day the sun's light dazzles, in the night the moon's light freezes. Only once a peace has been laid on the room will I be able to enter safely.
## Chapter House
> Here the monastic superiors would meet to manage the affairs of [[St Brandan's Abbey|St Brandan's]] and to resolve its disputes. Here in 1349, the last [[Trials of st Brandan's|trial]] of the last nuns of St Brandan's took place. Two were executed for the murder of [[Abbess Nonna]], supposedly with 'perversions of the healing arts'. Nonna was the last abbess of St Brandan's, and after the trial, the monastery never accepted female novices again. From the wide windows, the sea is always visible, beating on the rocks far below.
### Contents
- [[White Matilda (Statue)]]
### Desk - Nonna
  > [[Abbess Nonna]], apothecary, scholar, dancer.
### Echoing Chamber
>This has long been a holy place, but the voices of the monks have outlasted their prayers. A surly muttering circles the room, picking up speed as it goes. Each time it passes me, it almost manages to articulate my name.
