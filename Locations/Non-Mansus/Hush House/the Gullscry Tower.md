# Rooms
## Stair Tenebrous
> There were shadows here in the earth, long before the foundations of the House were laid. They retreated before [[Rome|the Romans]]' burrowings, they quailed before the sun-hymns of [[the Abbey|the brethren]], they slunk away before the blades and pistols of the Barons Dewulf. Over all those centuries they shrank, until at last when the Curia of the Isle sunk this stair, they could recruit [[Donkerling|one]] as a watch-dog.
## Night Gallery
> In the 1850s, and in deep secrecy, [[Natalia Brulleau|Natalie Brulleau]] built the Night Gallery into the foundations of the Gullscry Tower. Behind this heavy steel door the Curia, and later the Suppression Bureau, kept  treasures too difficult for common view, but too relevant to consign to a deeper vault. If anything difficult might, hypothetically, have been inclined to creep up the stairs from below, it would also have been discouraged by that door.

### Nocturnary
> Constructed by [[Thirza Blake|Thirza]] for her own murky purposes; maintained by the [[Suppression Bureau]] for its murkier ones; and available, now, for mine.
## Gullscry Loggia
> When [[Valentine Dewulf|Baron Valentine]]'s melancholia and his acusis became too much to bear, he began to take his meals here, with none of those sounds that he found troubling - only the wind, the sea, and the cries of his beloved birds. After the Dewulfs were gone, the Librarians of the Curia would come here when they needed to think in peace.
## Valentine's Room
> In his youth, Baron Valentine inclined to religion, and he made pilgrimages to holy sites on the Continent. After he made his final pilgrimage - to [[Fermier Abbey]] - the dreams began - of blood seeping from the earth; of a vast and pulsing [[the Wheel|Wheel]] crushing the temples of men; and, which troubled him most, of twisted birds, shrieking in pain, growing like fruit in the branches of [[the Malachite|an ancient Yew]].

## Eales' Room
> [[Eales Dewulf]] inherited his father Valentine's madness, and was found unfit to inherit, so his sister [[Eva Dewulf|Eva]] held the Isle in his stead. When his fits of violence became uncontrollable, he was confined here in the tower, where his sister would visit him three times a week - until his escape, some time in the late 1720s. Eales's ultimate fate remains unknown.

### Cage (workstation)
> Valentine Dewulf put his only friends in cages. Did he close the cage doors?
## Summit
> In 1721, Valentine fell - or leapt - from the tower top. There were no witnesses, and his body was not found for three days. His daughter Eva was the last to see him alive, and of their last conversation, she would say only that he had begun to fear the sun.
