For five hundred years - in the times we call [[Baronial Period|Baronial]], [[Curia Period|Curia]], [[Nocturnal Period|Nocturnal]] - there was always a keeper to watch the ways, weed the gardens, mend the roof when the sun was shining. There is no keeper now, but the Lodge's roof still weathers the storms of [[Brancrug Bay]].
