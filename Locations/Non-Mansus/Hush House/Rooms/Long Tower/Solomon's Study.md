> In 1818, the Very Reverend [[Solomon Husher]] became third Librarian of the Curia of the Isle. He took rooms in [[The Long Tower]] as his quarters. Husher's tastes were spartan; although the Curia generally liked a little more luxury, no-one ever quite dared to redecorate the place after his disappearance.
