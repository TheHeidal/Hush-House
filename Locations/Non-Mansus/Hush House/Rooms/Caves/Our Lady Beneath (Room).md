> Abandoned Church
> This is a holy place of the Sisterhood of the Triple Knot. The Hours they worshipped are not worshipped now, but those Hours are not dead, nor even sleeping. I should not enter this place without pouring out a sufficient offering.

> Who is 'Our Lady'? [[The Red Grail]], which gives life, which takes life, which is not sated? [[the Horned-Axe|The Horned-Axe]], who bears two blades, who waits and the threshold, who sunders that which should not be joined? [[the Malachite|the Ring-Yew]], who is succulent, who is renewed, who encompasseth? Or a fourth, who is always signified but never named?
>A Librarian might phrase the question differently: who was first?

# Contains:
- [[Aspect of the Malachite; Mylissa, Queen and Palace]]
- [[Aspect of the Axe - Xenodice Half-Faced]]
- [[Aspect of the Grail; Lagiah, the Queen Unsated]]
  
# Altar of the Knot
> History is woven; a knot is a testament.

Using [[Tridesma Hiera]] will reveal [[Serpent-Root]], as hinted in [[The Wonderful Shape]].
> Make the proper invocations to the Three, to reveal a treasure of the House.
>There in a smoothed hollow at the altar's foot - something coiled like a serpent, but stiller by far.
