 Here, the whole [[The Curia|Curia]] used to meet - the [[The Curia#Librarians|Librarian]], and the Secretaries [[Secretary Salvant|Salvant]], [[Secretary Vigilant|Vigilant]] and [[Secretary Enigmatic|Enigmatic]]. Sometimes even the [[Secretary Nunciant]], though the duties of that office usually kept him away from the House. But there has only ever been one [[Secretary Persistent]], and she has never liked to eat in company.

That was in the good times of the Curia's heyday. In later years, [[George Collers|the Governor of the Gaol]] would sit at one end, the Librarian at the other, and the clock would tick away the long silences between their words.
