In the days of the Dewulfs, this chamber was reserved for the lady of the House. Later, the Librarians [[Willem Harries]] and [[Gervinus van Lauren]] both preferred it to the [[Librarian's Quarters]]. Harries established a little shrine to [[the Mother of Ants|St Agnes]] in the far corner, and there it remained for many years until van Lauren ordered it to be removed.

## Guest Bed
> Six generations of Dewulf heirs were born in this room. It would have been seven, but Hafren Waters had the ill grace to give birth to Baron Walter in (family legend has it) a cow-byre outside Kerisham. 
## Violet Stool
> Damson cushion, holly-wood marquetry.

> The cushion is embroidered with the serpents of [[the Mother of Ants|St Agnes]].
## Chair of Challenges
> Here the Librarian Harries sat, to formulate the paradoxes he would bequeath to van Lauren.

>Perhaps the faintest, driest voice murmured: 'Who will see the Second Dawn?' Or perhaps that was only something that once I read.
## Chaise-Longue of Conclusions
> Here the Librarian van Lauren lay, to ponder the paradoxes he had inherited from Harries.

> 'Perhaps the faintest, driest voice murmured: 'The Librarian that comes after is not the Librarian.' Or perhaps that was only something that once we read.
