# Servants' Quarters - South
> When [[Hendrik Dewulf]] left behind the life of a mercenary, he appointed his quartermaster as head of his new household. This would have drawn little comment, except that his quartermaster was a woman - the soft-spoken, steely-willed [[Ernestine Peterhans]]. For more than five decades, these rooms were her unchallenged domain. Even in her eightieth year, she still walked her rounds every day, and the servants would fall silent at the distant jingle of her keys.
# Servants' Quarters - North
> This was once the private chamber of the formidable [[Ernestine Peterhans]], Seneschale of Brancrug. [[Hendrik Dewulf|Baron Hendrik]], and afterwards his son [[Thomas Dewulf|Thomas]], would both descend the back stairs to visit her in person. For counsel, most said; for prayers, others insisted. Only the very foolish ever suggested there was any improper motive for their visits.
# Back Stairs
> The secret artery of the House. All those abbots and barons and all their crowds of retainers needed their chamber pots emptying and their boots cleaning. These are the stairs that the boots and the chamber pots went up and down. They were notoriously cramped and treacherous. It was a rare year some poor scullion didn't crack an ankle. It was the [[Suppression Bureau]], at very long last, who remodelled the stairs and put in electric lights. And people say the Suppression Bureau never did Hush House any good!

# Foundry
> This room was set aside for metalworking by [[Hendrik Dewulf]]. There's always been a smithy in Brancrug Village, but Hendrik wanted to make sure he could have his pistol-balls cast and his prisoner-shackles mended, even if the villagers were feeling rebellious. When [[Ambrose Westcott]] arrived, he had little use for shackles and less for pistols; he refurbished the place for his metallurgical experiments. A bad place to be in summer, a good one in winter.
# Well
> There's been a well here since the days of [[The Sisterhood of the Knot|the Sisterhood]], and superstitions have gathered around it like leaves in drifts. Its water has a healing virtue if drawn on a night of the new moon. It's ill luck to draw from it if you hear an owl. If you drip the blood of a living enemy into the well, they'll drown. And so on. Certainly, when Numa comes, the mists lie thick here.
# Kitchen Garden
> In 1652, [[Musgrave Dewulf]] caught a travelling pedlar stealing vegetables from this garden - an eccentric wanderer who went by '[[Ricardo Milagro]]'. Musgrave's ancestors would simply have hung the fellow, but Musgrave decreed seven years' service in the garden instead. When the seven years were up, Milagro had proved his worth as a gardener and chose to make Brancrug his home. The grapevines here were planted with rootstock he carried in his pack.
# Wine Cellar
> [[Ricardo Milagro]], traveller, rascal, Musgrave's gardener, managed a creditable wine from Brancrug grapes. Cornwall has never really been wine country, and the tradition was unevenly maintained, but the Curia of the Isle kept a good cellar.
# Earth Cellar
> In the time of [[the Abbey|the Abbey]], this was a shrine to [[Saint Lucia the Eyeless|St Lucia the Eyeless]]. Since the heresies of the [[Intercalate]], [[the Church of the Unconquered Sun]] considers her an aspect of the Hour called [[the Meniscate|Meniscate]], but back then she was just the patron saint of stained-glass workers and eye doctors. The tree in Earl Brian's Field outside was traditionally hung with stained-glass ornaments on St Lucia's day.

> Since the dissolution of the Abbey, though, it's mostly been vegetables in here.
