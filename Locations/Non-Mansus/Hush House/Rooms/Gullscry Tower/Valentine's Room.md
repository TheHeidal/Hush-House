## Valentine's Room
> In his youth, Baron Valentine inclined to religion, and he made pilgrimages to holy sites on the Continent. After he made his final pilgrimage - to [[Fermier Abbey]] - the dreams began - of blood seeping from the earth; of a vast and pulsing [[the Wheel|Wheel]] crushing the temples of men; and, which troubled him most, of twisted birds, shrieking in pain, growing like fruit in the branches of [[the Malachite|an ancient Yew]].
