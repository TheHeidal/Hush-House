The physician [[Natan of Regensburg|Natan]] lived here in the fifteenth century - and his family after that, tolerated by the monks - until [[Henry VIII|King Henry]] dissolved the foundation and granted the Isle to [[Hendrik Dewulf|Hendrik]]. Hendrik turfed them out of the tower and furnished the place more to his own taste. But when [[Christopher Illopoly]] moved in four hundred years later, he restored what he could. Illopoly wrote at the time of his sympathy, as a rootless foundling, for the outcast Natan: <i>'I don't know what I am, but I don't think I'm English.'</i>
