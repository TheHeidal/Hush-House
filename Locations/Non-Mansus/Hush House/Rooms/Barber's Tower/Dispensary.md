This room may originally have served as a working dispensary, but some at least of its more eccentric fittings were added by [[Christopher Illopoly]] in his time here. By that point he had severed ties with [[Fraser Strathcoyne|his adoptive father]]. He'd been using the Illopoly name for years and had no access to the Strathcoyne fortune - but '[[Travelling at Night]]' had sold surprisingly well (much better than [[Just Verse|his poetry]]) and he had a little money of his own by then - enough to indulge his preferences.
