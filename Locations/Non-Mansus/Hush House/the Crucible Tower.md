# Governor's Office
> The Governor's office - quietly luxurious, at least by the standards of the Cucurbit. Collers was devoted to his cause and his service, but he did insist on his little pleasures.
### Contents
- [[Genealogical Chart]]
# Governor's Quarters
> In this room, the Governor was Collers the artist, Collers the dreamer. It was a side of him that almost no-one saw, especially when, after the death of his wife, he grew so much more solitary. That said, there is a connection to be drawn between his enthusiasm for sculpture, and his ambitions for his human subjects.
#### Sculptor's Bench
>Labour seriously.
#### Governor's Phonograph
> Collers generally preferred his devices to be as gleamingly modern as possible, but he preferred phonograph cylinders over the newer gramophone records. The cylinder, like the records, exemplified ingenuity and reliably repeated the desired sounds, but they also could be consigned neatly to a cubbyhole without causing any sort of fuss.

# Interview Laboratory
>When a prisoner resisted all other interventions, [[George Collers|Collers]] would bring them here, to test and refine their worth. His successes might be transferred to Zurich, or turned over to [[the LÃ©gion du Seuil]] to earn their humanity, or even, at least once, released. But his successes were not numerous.
>Here, at last, is where the fire began and where it ended. When the power below the prison was released, it came here to interview Collers. Perhaps it intended to put him in his own device; but it seems there was not nearly enough left of him for that.
#### Condignator
> The terrible heart of the Governor's terrible project.
###  Charred Chamber
> The iron door here stands ajar - but it still glows faintly red, even after all these years. This is not a natural heat, and there is no entirely natural way to quell it.
