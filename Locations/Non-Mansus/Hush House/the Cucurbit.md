# Outside
## Lesser Bridge
> Brancrug Gaol: built in 1896 at the behest of [[Nocturnal Branch]], to contain 'troubles unseemly and occult'. A mere six years later, after [[1902; Skolekosophy|the Ortucchio Incident]], the Branch came itself to be considered 'unseemly and occult', and its functions were absorbed into the [[Suppression Bureau]]. But the Gaol still stands.
> Over the gate is the Bureau's motto: ALLIS SI LICET, TIBI NON LICET, commonly rendered as IT IS PERMITTED TO US; IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO YOU.
## Gaol Yard
> The gaol was nicknamed the 'Cucurbit', for the alchemist's flask that distils and refines. Prisoners would become better versions of themselves, realigned to responsibility. Hence, though it would have been much safer to confine the more potent inmates to their sealed cells, [[George Collers|Governor Collers]] insisted that even they should be allowed fresh air and exercise.
## Gaol Hall
### Worm-Eaten Hall
> This place bears the unmistakable traces of Worms - the 'serpents which are no serpents'. They are almost certainly gone... but we'll take no chances. Worms are difficult to evict from buildings, but much harder to evict from people.
> 
>Here the guards and the prisoners would take their meals. Sometimes Collers, too, would descend from his tower and discuss philosophy with poisoners, ethics with [[Antaians]], theology with [[labhites]]. Afterwards he would generally burn his notes.
## Gaol Kitchen
> 'There are no Hours at Brancrug,' Collers used to say - even before he was Governor of Brancrug Gaol, when he was only [[Secretary Vigilant]] of the Curia. By way of reminder, the hands were confiscated from every timepiece within the prison walls. The warders could still rely on the chimes of the [[great Clock]] in the abbey spire. But it did make life harder for the cooks.
###  Worm-Gnawed Kitchen
> This kitchen has clearly been penetrated and polluted by Worms - the 'parasites of the Sun'. The Worms are long gone. But the kitchen will need scouring, it will need decontaminating, and then it will definitely need all its food throwing out. Even if it's tinned.
## Loading Dock
Here the supplies came in, from every continent that the seas touch - from the Bounds, and beyond. Now and then prisoners would try to escape, but the sea is always hungry.
# Below
## Gaol Cellar

The entrance to the sub-cellar was barred, locked, chained, warded, both physically and otherwise. Whatever was kept down there, they took it extremely seriously.

It looks very much as if the questing [[Worms]] broke the seals, drawn by the power below. It looks very much as if they regretted it.
## Oubliette
> Here in a vessel shaped by fire and fate, George Collers confined a flame in human flesh, a blazing shadow of a blazing future, a Name of greed and time. Greene called it 'the Sun's bastard grandchild.' Van Lauren warned of 'the Second Dawn's first spark'. But Collers spoke of it reverently: as '[[Wickel Inextinguishable|the Leashed Flame's true heir]]'.

The Oubliette can be opened with [[Disciplines of the Scar]] or [[Disciplines of the Hammer]], granting access to a numen. This is hinted at in [[The Chandler's Wish]], suggesting [[the Chandler]] has passed through it.

# Prison
## Staff-Room
> The warders at Brancrug were a cut above your usual prison warder - former Bureau constables, repentant [[Know]], turncoat [[Tragulari]], veterans of [[the Légion du Seuil|the Légion du Seuil]]. When the end came, none of that mattered. But here, for a while, when the winter storms battered the walls, they hunkered close to this glowing stove to share tea and comradeship and stories of their very different lives.
## Cell: Adepts
> Seventy-seven days in the Cucurbit was considered enough to soften the passions of the most unrepentant adept. After that, they were usually charged and tried in closed court; very occasionally released; sometimes taken upstairs for one of Collers' experimental interviews
### Contents
- [['Julian Coseley']]
- [['ALIIS LICET TIBI NON LICET' (Sign)]]
- #### Prison Stool
> A cheerful lavender colour, possibly to encourage rehabilitative enthusiasm.
> Someone has scratched a series of tally marks down one leg. Seventy-seven days.
###  Sealed Cell
> A sign outside this cell reads WARNING: DO NOT INSERT KEYS WITHOUT FIRST INVOKING ADEQUATE AUTHORISATION. The key is in the Staff-Room, but I shouldn't turn it without invoking powers to provide a reasonable facsimile of authorisation.
## Cell: ?

This was the last prisoner to be admitted to the Gaol, but only the date has been recorded. No record of its origin, crime, or arrest remains. Collers was a man of many secrets. Sometimes, however, he was also a generous man, and he insisted it be provided with a bed and with writing materials, should it ever feel the need for them.

Probably has some relation to [[the Carapace Cross]]
### Contents:
#### Chrysalis
Something might emerge, if it could only be assured of a hospitable History. Until that time, its dreams might be audible to one who presses an ear against its trembling, sky-scented warmth.
## Cell: Worm-Inhabited
> The occupant of <i>this</i> cell could not be allowed fresh air and exercise. It could not have reasonably expected to leave this cell ever again, even while it wore human shape. But it could not be confined forever; in the end, somehow, it found its way into the walls.
## Cell: Long

The few Long at Brancrug were kept in cells triple-buttressed with silver and steel and sanctioned spells. The Bureau knew their weaknesses, but never relied upon them. This cell last housed <i>two</i> immortals - an [[Edge-long]] dyad. This would have required not only ferocious and eternal vigilance, but also frequent replacement of shattered furniture.
