# Rooms
## Sea-Caves
> The Curia's last secret. Right under [[George Collers|Governor Collers]]' nose, [[Brian Levinsen|Levinsen]], [[Serena Blackwood|Blackwood]] and [[Gervinus van Lauren|van Lauren]] all continued their careful investigations of the Brancrug sea-caves. Many of the species here are unknown to Cornwall. Some have not been seen anywhere under this Sun.
## Deeplight Caves
> When the [[gods-from-stone]] were swept away, [[the Carapace Cross|Carapace Cross]] who had served them were swept away too. [[The Seglaz-kind]], [[the Wyrmefota-kind]], [[the Glaeterfloge-kind]], all those wise and mighty ones are gone, into [[Nowhere]] or hiding or us. Here in the fire-warmed waters, away from the justice of sunlight, their legacy quietly thrives.
###  Menacing Phosphorescence
> The pumps have drained enough water to splash through, but everything is spatched and splotted with sickly, alien, wonderous, mesmeric light. When I retreat, I find the same glow on my boots. Whatever I do, I should not do it hastily.
## Shrine to St Tentreto
>[[The Carapace Cross]], the hybrid race who in their many kinds were winged, legged, eyed, bright, dark, scaled, feathered, chitinous... and us? The Cross are gone; the Cross were always History; but to their children, their enemies, they leave this hushed legacy.
### Pulsing Darkness
> If the Isle had a heart, we would hear its pulse.
### Contains:
- [[Altar - St Tentreto]]
