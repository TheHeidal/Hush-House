Made up of the 
# Gatehouse
> Back in the eleventh century, [[Earl Brian|Brian of Brittany]] built the Tower and its gate to protect [[St Brandan's Abbey|St Brandan's Abbey]] - as Hush House was then known. Later, the Barons Dewulf strengthened the gate against their many enemies. But it's a long time now since [[Hush House]] was any kind of fortress... and by the time the scholars of the [[The Curia|Curia]] took possession, this place had long been a comfortable waiting room for visitors to the House too minor to merit immediate attention.
# First Floor
> The notorious [[Eva Dewulf]], first and last Baroness Brancrug, liked this room. Because this side of the house carried fewest memories of her poor father [[Valentine Dewulf|Valentine]]? So she could eavesdrop on the conversations of visitors waiting below? Or just because of how the pale light slanted through the windows in the last days of winter?

# Observatory
> [[Thomas Dewulf]], second Baron Brancrug, who they called 'Baron Silence', built this observatory in 1576 - by happy coincidence, just in time to observe the passage of [[the Great Comet]] in 1577.
