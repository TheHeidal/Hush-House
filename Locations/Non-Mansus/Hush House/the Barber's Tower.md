# Rooms
## Infirmary
In the fifteenth century, [[Natan of Regensburg]] came to Brancrug. The brothers of [[St Brandan's Abbey|St Brandans]] granted sanctuary, but they would not permit a Jew - and his family! - to live on abbey grounds. Still they built this tower for him to dwell in and practice his healing arts. It has changed greatly since that time, but a place of healing it remains.
## Patients' Lounge
In this room, the accursed of [[the Great War]] gathered to recuperate - those who had suffered something no more horrible, but somewhat more mysterious, than the War's usual wounds to body and spirit - an irruption of [[Worms]], perhaps, or the risks at the military end of [[Suppression Bureau]] activities. Among them were minor luminaries of the invisible world - [[Christopher Illopoly]], [[Mr Zachary Wakefield|Zachary Wakefield]], [[Harvey Hattington]]. But not [[Brian Levinsen]], who had been ninth Librarian, and under whose tenure the Infirmary had flourished. He enlisted; he served for a time as a medical officer on the Western Front; his body was never found.
## Examination Room
[[Hendrik Dewulf]] evicted the family of the healer [[Natan of Regensburg|Natan]] from the Barber's Tower - as it was then called. ('I have rooted out the barber's brood,' he is recorded to have gloated.) But his great-great-grandson [[Gideon Dewulf|Gideon]] - 'the Motley Baron', for his brindled hair - restored the Tower and made it a place of healing again. Of course the equipment in this room dates from the current century. But Gideon's other nickname was 'the Cutter'. It was rumoured that he bought corpses for dissection - even that he was a vivisectionist. The latter was probably a slander, but one way or another, scholars have been cutting up corpses in here for a very long time.
## Illopoly's Nook
>The door jams half-open, but the room above is a bright oasis after the dreary neglect of the lower tower. The previous occupant has probably left some sort of protections in place. I'll find somebody suitably qualified to deal with them.

[[Christopher Illopoly]] - poet, painter, archivist, ruiner of seances - stayed on for a while at Hush House after [[the Great War]]. The Librarian, [[Serena Blackwood]], arranged rooms for Illopoly in the Motley Tower, ostensibly so he could help with the collection, but perhaps also because she saw a potential ally against [[George Collers|the Governor]] of [[the Cucurbit]]... relations between the Cucurbit and the House were badly strained at the time.[^1]
### Contains:
- Elegant Sunburst Lamp
  > A bright tree of brass.
	> An inscription on the pediment reads 'The [[Gods-from-steel]] did not exist.'

## Dispensary
This room may originally have served as a working dispensary, but some at least of its more eccentric fittings were added by [[Christopher Illopoly]] in his time here. By that point he had severed ties with [[Fraser Strathcoyne|his adoptive father]]. He'd been using the Illopoly name for years and had no access to the Strathcoyne fortune - but '[[Travelling at Night]]' had sold surprisingly well (much better than [[Just Verse|his poetry]]) and he had a little money of his own by then - enough to indulge his preferences.
### Contents:
- #### Brazen Clock:
> It's not immediately apparent that this clock lacks hands, although, when wound, it dutifully ticks.
> An inscription reads: 'For D.M. Time is; Time was; Time is past.'
## Regensburg Room
The physician [[Natan of Regensburg|Natan]] lived here in the fifteenth century - and his family after that, tolerated by the monks - until [[Henry VIII|King Henry]] dissolved the foundation and granted the Isle to [[Hendrik Dewulf|Hendrik]]. Hendrik turfed them out of the tower and furnished the place more to his own taste. But when [[Christopher Illopoly]] moved in four hundred years later, he restored what he could. Illopoly wrote at the time of his sympathy, as a rootless foundling, for the outcast Natan: <i>'I don't know what I am, but I don't think I'm English.'</i>
### 'Our Benefactress'
> Evidently someone who donated to the Curia… but preferred to remain anonymous.
> She's wearing a little silver brooch fashioned in the shape of a cat's head.
### 'Our Benefactor'
> Evidently someone who donated to the Curia… but preferred to remain anonymous.
> He's wearing a little silver brooch fashioned in the shape of a fox's head.
