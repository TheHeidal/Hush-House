## Examination Room
[[Examination Room]]
## Illopoly's Nook
>The door jams half-open, but the room above is a bright oasis after the dreary neglect of the lower tower. The previous occupant has probably left some sort of protections in place. I'll find somebody suitably qualified to deal with them.

[[Christopher Illopoly]] - poet, painter, archivist, ruiner of seances - stayed on for a while at Hush House after [[the Great War]]. The Librarian, [[Serena Blackwood]], arranged rooms for Illopoly in the Motley Tower, ostensibly so he could help with the collection, but perhaps also because she saw a potential ally against [[George Collers|the Governor]] of [[the Cucurbit]]... relations between the Cucurbit and the House were badly strained at the time.[^1]
### Contains:
- Elegant Sunburst Lamp
  > A bright tree of brass.
	> An inscription on the pediment reads 'The [[Gods-from-steel]] did not exist.'

## Dispensary
This room may originally have served as a working dispensary, but some at least of its more eccentric fittings were added by [[Christopher Illopoly]] in his time here. By that point he had severed ties with [[Fraser Strathcoyne|his adoptive father]]. He'd been using the Illopoly name for years and had no access to the Strathcoyne fortune - but '[[Travelling at Night]]' had sold surprisingly well (much better than [[Just Verse|his poetry]]) and he had a little money of his own by then - enough to indulge his preferences.
### Contents:
- #### Brazen Clock:
> It's not immediately apparent that this clock lacks hands, although, when wound, it dutifully ticks.
> An inscription reads: 'For D.M. Time is; Time was; Time is past.'
## Regensburg Room
The physician [[Natan of Regensburg|Natan]] lived here in the fifteenth century - and his family after that, tolerated by the monks - until [[Henry VIII|King Henry]] dissolved the foundation and granted the Isle to [[Hendrik Dewulf|Hendrik]]. Hendrik turfed them out of the tower and furnished the place more to his own taste. But when [[Christopher Illopoly]] moved in four hundred years later, he restored what he could. Illopoly wrote at the time of his sympathy, as a rootless foundling, for the outcast Natan: <i>'I don't know what I am, but I don't think I'm English.'</i>
### 'Our Benefactress'
> Evidently someone who donated to the Curia… but preferred to remain anonymous.
> She's wearing a little silver brooch fashioned in the shape of a cat's head.
### 'Our Benefactor'
> Evidently someone who donated to the Curia… but preferred to remain anonymous.
> He's wearing a little silver brooch fashioned in the shape of a fox's head.
