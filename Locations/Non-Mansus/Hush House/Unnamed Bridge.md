>  Rattling Bridge

Each time the wind makes its rounds, the whole bridge shakes. On its threshold, there's a serpentine knot-mark in browned blood. The mark is fading, but it still trembles with the power of the spirit that waits in it - a great servant of the old House, perhaps the last of the Fine-Takers themselves. I must pacify it with a suitable offering before I can pass.
