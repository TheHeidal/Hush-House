A location in [[the Mansus]], reachable from [[The Wood]].

## [[Knock Lore#Subtle Flaw|Subtle Flaw]]:
Last night I came in the Wood to the high jagged rock called the Temple of the Wheel. Its flank, patched with black lichen and eye-signs, opened like a mouth beneath my hands, and I walked in the whispering space within. The [[Gods-who-were-stone]], the first of the Hours, are almost all gone now, but here their voices remain: [[the Wheel|Wheel]], [[the Flint|Flint]], [[the Tide|Tide]], the others without names.
## [[Heart Lore#Trembling Airs|Trembling Airs]]:
In the Wood beyond the walls of the Mansus, a jagged rock rears like the petrified remnants of a dancing giant. I trailed my hand along its flank, over the eye-signs and lichen and the crude graffiti of the lesser Wood-powers, and I felt the thrumming of the Wheel which has passed. It has passed, but something continues.
## [[Secret Histories Lore#A Furtive Truth|A Furtive Truth]]:
In my sleep I came to the high jagged rock which is still called the Temple of the Wheel, though the Hour called Wheel is long extinct. Another hand had scratched a secret in the black lantern on its flank. I burned that secret into my memory to preserve for waking, before [[the Velvet]] came out of the velvet Wood-depths and erased it. The Velvet is jealous of her secrets.
