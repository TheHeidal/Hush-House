# Draws:
## [[An Awareness of Appetite]]:
The Well in the Wood is never dry, but it is never clear. One night it might heave with crawling roots; on another, it will pulse with bright moss. On nights of the full moon its waters are choked with the fat dappled bodies of moths. Last night, I saw it brimming with dark and viscous blood. Gelatinous shreds drifted on its surface; clots of Grail-matter.
## [[Vitality]]:
The Well in the Wood is sacred to [[the Red Grail|the Grail]], the Hour that hungers, and to [[the Velvet]], the Hour that guards secrets... tonight as I approached, it heaved with the Velvet's moss, struggling waves of deep and vibrant green, pulsing again and again from its throat. It surged around my calves, rose to my thighs, and this morning I still feel the Velvet's breath, strong within me.
