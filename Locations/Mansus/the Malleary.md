## An Incandescence
> Last night in the Mansus I visited the Malleary, from whose engines and avenues one does not emerge unchanged. I watched the processes of sunset and I entered the amber joy and the white joy and the blue joy and I was subjected to the enlightenments of calcination and [[the Forge of Days]] touched me with her burnished fingers and I rise from my bed with the utter knowledge that all nights, all nights, all nights must end.

## Unresolved Ambiguity
> Last night in the Mansus I visited the Malleary, from whose hammers and crucibles one does not emerge unchanged, and for nine beats my heart ceased while it entered the fires of the Forge, and the passions of the Forge entered into it. I woke with the dawn, and its poor divided colours inspire memories of the Forge's passion for the Sun, of the Vagabond's curse, of the Grail's deep longing... so many half-memories.
