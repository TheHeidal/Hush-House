>An enclave beyond [[the Evening Isles]] (and in [[the Bounds]]) established by an alliance of Catholic friars with Incan magicians. It preserves those things that are elsewhere considered unwise to preserve. The Haustorium lies beneath the hand of [[the Crowned Growth]]. It is in no way a safe place to visit, nor even really to communicate with. It's probably not even a good idea to dream about it.
