# Summary
Manifesto for experimental and dangerous-sounding invocatory poetry, written some time in the nineteenth century by [[Dr Arun Peel]]. A notoriously inconsistent and incoherent text, apparently produced in a tearing hurry.
# Commentary
Not to everyone's taste, I know -'

'A prophet is without honour in his own country, as the saying has it; and I'm pretty much from everywhere these days, so I suppose no one will ever really take me seriously again. Mind if I take a look? I can point out a couple of the better bits. And I'll keep my gloves on.'

'Here. And here. And the editor tried to take <i>that</i> bit out. So I arranged a motivational sort of dream. Worth it.'
