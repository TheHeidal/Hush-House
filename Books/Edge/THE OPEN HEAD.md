# Summary
[[Ilse Bischoff]]'s hallucinatory quasi-documentary, notionally about the Greco-Turkish War of the previous decade.
# Reading
A hammer-armed Turk and a sword-armed Greek pursue each other through the Pindus, setting traps for each other, robbing peasants, chalking insulting graffiti on walls. The tone is notionally anti-war, but any scholar of the invisible arts would recognise the Edge-hour subtext... and the Hyksos messages in the graffiti.
# Read
The sword-wielder methodically fills a church with candles; lights each one; strips, again, to the waist to reveal his terrible scars; his chest somehow swings open like a cupboard door to reveal a blood-drenched bookâ€¦ and the film ends.
# Notes
That's obviously the [[The Lionsmith|Lionsmith]] and the [[The Colonel|Colonel]].
