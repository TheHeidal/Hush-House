# Summary
> Once upon a time, a very bad man encoded very bad secrets into the charming illustrations of a book of charming stories. Wake the pictures, and you will see. \[This book houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
# Reading
> [[Jacob Gristwood|Lord Jacob Gristwood]]: surgeon, ethnologist, philanthropist. There is no proof that he ever kept children in hutches beneath his bed. There is no proof he vivisected cats at dinner with his pen-knife. The Suppression Bureau keeps its secrets.
# Read
> 'Here is your paint,' whispered the Wolf to the Pale Girl. 'Here is your knife-for-scraping. And here is your face.'
# Notes
The Wolf is presumably a reference to [[the Wolf-Divided]].
