# Summary
>A confidential journal kept by [[Sir David Greene|Greene]], former Nocturnal Branch Superindent but, by 1903, Librarian of the House. Greene has kept his journal in Hyksos, presumably as an extra measure of privacy.
# Reading
> In 1903, the House co-operated closely with the Branch, and Greene was the public face of that co-operation. In private, however, Greene is clearly disillusioned with the Branch, which he increasingly regards as irresponsible. He is especially concerned about the construction of a 'suppressive mechanism' beneath Brancrug Gaol, and its likely occupant.
> 
> 'Hours and Names are dangerous,' he writes, 'but at least our dealings have the benefit of long experience. An Hour who acts before she is born - who leaves those places she has never entered - if her Names walk the world already, how can we understand their courses and their capabilities?'
# Read
> The last entries alternate between calculations (tides, dates, financial calculations) and expressions of fevered longing for '[[A.F.|A.F]]'. It seems that Greene intends to run away with A.F., and some of the calculations imply that he has been embezzling funds to that end, under cover of the chaos caused by the Ortucchio Incident and the subsequent reorganisation of Nocturnal Branch into the Suppression Bureau... 
> 
> The entries, however, stop abruptly before the year's end. It's not clear whether Greene did in fact abscond with funds and fond friend, or whether he abandoned this journal for other reasons.
