# Summary
[[Willis-Ford]] describes [[the War of the Roads]], an event in a History other than our own, in detail - from its beginnings as a martial-philosophical dispute between [[the House of York|the Dawn]] and [[the House of Lancaster|the Sunset Roads]] of alchemy, to a war which ravaged half of Europe. 
# Reading
It is not now widely believed that the sons and daughters of [[the Red Rose|the Red Rose]] were forged into immortals. Understandably: they are, after all, now all long dead. The Forge itself devoured the greatest among them.'
# Read
The royalty of England, according to Willis-Ford, became [[the Sovereigns of the Leashed Flame]], destroying or transforming their enemies, conquering Europe, establishing grand cathedrals to St Spark. The alliance with the Forge begins to take its toll. At last, the Bronze King undergoes his 'Great Misfortune' and 'Great Debasement', and is afterwards known as the Copper King. His attempt to cheat the Forge ends badly, the Leashed Flame is released, and the King's heirs are merely mortal sovereigns.
# Speculation
The Red Rose is another term for the House of Lancaster.
