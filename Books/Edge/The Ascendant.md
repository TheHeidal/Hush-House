# Summary
> The Edge-long [[Dearday|Dardesh]] boasts of her victories over her brother-enemy [[Torgue|Tareg]] in the days of [[the Shadowless Empire]].
# Reading
> 'Sweeter than wine, than nectar is the blood of my brother. We have raised up armies one against another, we have sated [[the Blackbone]] with the sinking of our shipsâ€¦'
# Read
> Dardesh's boasting at length turns melancholy. An Edge-long is half a dyad; she may not defeat her hated brother-enemy without ending herself. She doesn't even want to; but she is aware, to her frustration, that she is 'a piece on the board, an axle on the ox-cart' - an essential part of [[the Corrivality|the eternal engine of contention]] which the Lionsmith and Colonel use to sustain the world.
