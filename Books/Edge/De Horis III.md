# Summary
In Latin. A nineteenth-century reprint (by the indefatigable [[Nathaniel Darcy-Evers]]) of a fourteenth-century Latin translation of a fourth-century work.
# Reading
This is usually described as the third volume of [['De Horis']], but Darcy-Evers' foreword argues persuasively that it's a substantial reworking by the original authorâ€¦
# Read
[[The Lionsmith]] makes monsters, [[the Colonel]] has his scars, but the De Horis now insists that neither can truly defeat the other; that they must at some level understand these limits in their strategies; and that [[the Corrivality|their enmity]] is an 'eternal engine of the world.'
