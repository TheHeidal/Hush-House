# Summary
> Dialogues with [[bees]] and uses for honey, as erratically recorded by [[Ricardo Milagro]], gardener of Hush House in [[Musgrave Dewulf|Musgrave]]'s time.
# Reading
> Milagro spends an entire chapter on his hatred of [[wasps]], which he describes as 'the Vile Pretenders'.
# Read
>Milagro claims that bees retain many traditions passed down from earlier and greater branches of their species, but that they are fiercely jealous of these traditions being passed to lesser insects, and insist above all on an oath of secrecy. Tragically, therefore, he is unable to describe these more substantial and powerful traditions.
