# Summary
>Detailed accounts of secret bachanals and ecstatic dances observed in necropolises and graveyards in Southern Europe, in [[Egypt]] and in [[Anatolia]]. The author is a self-confessed [[ghoul]], an eater of buried flesh: he claims to have witnessed the dances while at his [[the feast|feasting]].
# Reading
>The dances draw from the traditions of the Mysteries, of the cults of [[Isis]] and of [[Cybele]], but include both symbolic and literal [[flaying|flayings]], and the human heart is always central in the rites. The author punctuates his accounts with queasily sensuous descriptions of his own interrupted feasts.
# Read
>At these greater Feasts a Black Pig is always crowned as King before its Slaying. On this Occasion, its Heart was weighed in the Balance against a Knot of Feathers, and its Skin became a Cape for the Officiant. Its Flesh was left for the Crows, but I must confess my Interest was not in its Carcass but in the Perfumed Flesh of the Milliner laid fresh in the Earth.'
