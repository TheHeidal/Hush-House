> The poem is a substantial variation on the Fisher-King tale. A wounded wasteland monarch learns that he and his land can be cured, but that the cure is their own response to ever more savage maladiesâ€¦
# Read
> Gideon concludes with a concrete example: that the Mysteries can be used to despoil '[[Gideon's Soaks|mine own Soaks]]', but then the Soak can then be refined with sufficient Heart into '[[January Sanguinary|the sanguis saltandis]]'.
