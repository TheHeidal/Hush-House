# Summary
> An anonymous biography of [[Eva Dewulf]], last of the [[Dewulfs]], focused rather salaciously on her personal troubles and intrigues.
# Reading
> Eva Dewulf is engaged to one [[Abraham Wheelock]], but he leaves her at the altar[^1]. Furious and humiliated, she returns to Brancrug, and is not seen in London again. Three days after her departure, Abraham Wheelock's body is washed up near Gravesend. His face is so badly pecked by birds that he is only identified by his belongings. These include a waxed pouch containing a letter addressed to Wheelock, whose contents seem to show he is a spy in the pay of the Austrians. Subsequent investigations suggest that the letter is a forgery, but the matter remains obscure...
# Read
> [[Franklin Bancroft|Lord Franklin Bancroft]], sometimes called the Prince of Wines, begins a series of visits to Brancrug House. His relationship with Eva becomes a source of scandal. Eva is by now forty-nine, but rumours persist for years of a Dewulf-Bancroft heir. Eva's biographer claims that before her 'drowning death', her child by Bancroft was adopted by her friends [[the Southeys]] - that the child became the sister of the later Poet Laureate, [[Robert Southey]]. (No real evidence is provided in support of this claim.)
