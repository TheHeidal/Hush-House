# Summary
> A sixteenth-century translation of [[the Barrowchild]]'s account of '[[Lagiah's Turn]]' - when [[Lagiah]], the Queen Unsated, was offered the opportunity to enter the service of the Hours of [[the Triple Knot|the Triple Knot]], as long as she repudiated her brother-lover [[Antaios]].
# Reading
> Lagiah accepts, setting aside 'the arts of [[the egg unhatching|the low red sun]]' associated with Antaios. She bargains, however, for freedom for [[her daughters]]. The Hours of the Triple Knot accept casually, knowing that Lagiah has devoured her daughters - but wily Lagiah has decided, 'in the secret hollow of her heart', that she will adopt any who ask, if they can prove their fierceness.
# Read
> The traditions described here - the ones generally described as 'Hill and Hollow' - are associated with Lagiah before her Turn; but now that she's a Name of [[the Red Grail]], they might also be safely used before an altar of the Triple Knot.
