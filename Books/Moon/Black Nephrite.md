# Summary
One of [[Valentine Dewulf]]'s dream-journals, in which he records his visions of 'a place that is no place, beneath the house that is no house.'
# Reading
The dark, inchoate, feral space described by Valentine seems to be the '[[Nowhere]]' of the Invisible Arts - the infra-oneiric lair of the alien Hours sometimes called [[gods-from-Nowhere]].
# Read
Valentine's attitude to the Nowhere-Hours is unexpectedly relaxed. He speaks darkly of their appetites, but he insists they are too alien to penetrate the House of the Sun, let alone the waking world. He even seems to suggest that the [[Mansus-Hours]] have exaggerated the threat of the Nowhere-Hours for their own reasons. 'Not all [[birds]] are trustworthy in their Feathers', he warns.
# Speculations
What is [[Nephrite]]?
