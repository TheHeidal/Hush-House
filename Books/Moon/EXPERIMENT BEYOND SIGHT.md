# Summary
> [[Ilse Bischoff]]'s bewildering, widely derided final film.
# Reading
> The film is an unrelenting fusillade of apparently unrelated images - [[birth]], [[mirrors (theme)|mirrors]], grain-threshers, animal attacks, crowds at stations… but a single image appears again and again, dominating the rush of images until the film is only a single static shot.
# Read
> The repeating image is a view through a grimy window-pane of a nearby tower. There is a vague impression of flickering light around the tower-top. Just as the film ends, smoke plumes from the tower. That's it. Nothing of note at all… unless one happens to recognise the view of [[the Crucible Tower]] from the window of the [[Librarian's Quarters]], and unless one happens to know that Ilse Bischoff never visited [[Brancrug]], or even Britain, before her untimely death.
