# Summary
> [[Ehsan Fekri]], one-time [[Secretary Salvant]] of the Curia of the Isle - responsible for the Curia's healing efforts - writes of his experiences in Brancrug, and hints at his travels elsewhere.
# Reading
> 'The Sea does not regret the tide,' Fekri writes, 'for when the tide has passed, it leaves its traces on the sand; which traces are the Sea's memory.'
# Read
> Fekri is a keen fisherman, and speaks glowingly of the fish suppers of Brancrug. He also admits that his enthusiasm for 'the bounty of the sea' has altered him - that before he came to Brancrug, he consumed only those things found in the earth. 'I was the greater thereby, but all of us give up what we were, to become what we are.'
