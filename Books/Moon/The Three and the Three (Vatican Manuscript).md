# Summary
A Church-authorised version of an older text, this book describes [[the Chancel]] and [[Calyptra|the Calyptra]], two triads of Hours with subtle, far-reaching powers and responsibilities. It has clearly been reworked to fit Church doctrine.
# Reading
 'The deepest knowledge is forbidden to all mortals except those who seek it beneath the Watchman's Tree. It is Calyptra that planted that tree, but it is the Chancel, the Cruciate, that has elected Calyptra. Who then elected the Cruciate? Or is this, as the saying goes, 'a matter of Janus'?
# Read
'[[The Twins|The Sister-and-Witch]] is Cruciate, but [[The Twins|The Witch-and-Sister]] is not. Even those powers that demand a conjunction are not always conjoined. When the Sister is Nowhere, does this mean Nowhere sits <i>in crucem</i>?'
# Speculation
Apparents [[the Vatican]] exists?
