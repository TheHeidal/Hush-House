# Summary
> [[Julian Coseley]]'s epistolary treatise on 'what may come after', addressed to his once-friend [[Claude Hersault]], the mystic and antiquarian.
# Reading
> By the time he wrote these letters, Coseley was identified with the oneiropolitical '[[Worms (movement)|Worms]]' movement, and Hersault with the '[[Birds (movement)|Birds]]' - meaning roughly that Hersault held the order of the Hours to be desirable, and Coseley held it to be oppressive.
# Read
> Many of Coseley's arguments about consequence and finality are couched in erudite and practical alchemical terms. Others appear to be thinly-veiled threats directed at Hersault. Some are both.
