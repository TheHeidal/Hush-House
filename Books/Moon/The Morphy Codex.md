# Summary
> A priestess of the Sisterhood of the Knot claims to have discerned the true meaning of [[the Thunderskin]]'s birth.
# Reading
> The writer credits [[the Red Grail]], [[the Malachite|the Ring-Yew]] and [[the Horned-Axe]] - the powers the Sisterhood reveres - with agreeing a final treaty between the Hours of the House and the Hours they'd displaced: the Thunderskin loved the Yew, and the Grail destroyed him, as restitution for the slaying of the Horned-Axe's sisters and brothers.
# Read
> The Thunderskin entered the Mansus through [[the Peacock Door]], 'a privilege never given to [[The Twins|The Witch-and-Sister]]: but then their merit was much less'. The writer admits that entry through the Peacock Door is unseemly, but insists that under the circumstances, there was no other way.
