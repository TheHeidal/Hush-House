# Summary
> Simple but forceful techniques for 'rousting unbefitting spirits', written in straightforward and colourful language.
# Reading
>[[Thirza Blake|Blake]] seems uncertain at points whether the techniques are intended for use <i>by</i> or <i>on</i> girls. She clearly regards children as a nuisance.
# Read
>Thirza's advice on the shapeless Wood-things known as [[Raw Prophet|Raw Prophets]] is typically practical: (1) discourage them with buckets of water as close as possible to freezing, and with the smoke of dried lemongrass (2) under no circumstances kiss them or receive kisses from them. (3) an effective formula is provided for laundering clothes stained with Prophet-slime.
