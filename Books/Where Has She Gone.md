# Summary
> '[[The Speeth]]' - perhaps a single adept, perhaps a council of scholars - hypothesises secret events from limited evidence with persuasive accuracy.
# Reading
> [[the Vagabond]] is recorded to have travelled not only the Mansus and the Wood, not only all nine continents, but also places forbidden to other Hours...
# Read
> From Hour-gossip and invisible lore, Speeth deduces that the Vagabond has visited Nowhere, but that she will not return. He also asserts that she has yet to visit the Glory, but that inevitably, this must be her goal.
