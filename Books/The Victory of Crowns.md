# Summary
> Erratic accounts by '[[Dr Arun Peel|Arun]]' of the hunting and consumption of supposed immortals by shadowy assassins. Published in the late nineteenth century.
# Reading
> The assassins are, according to 'Arun', the agents of a power called [[The Colonel|the Coronel]], a 'soldier of the Secret Masters'. The accounts date back to Roman times.
# Read
> Arun's scholarship is dubious, but he (she?) writes pithily. Incidents of sudden and violent death are interspersed with aphorisms: 'Hours don't dream. Long try not to.'
# Speculation
Might be refering to [[labhites]].

# 'The Victory of Crowns?'
> 'You know, I can never quite remember if that's actually one of mine. Or one of, um, another mine. Do you mind if I take it away with me? I'll swap you the other books I happen to be carrying. No, I won't tell you what those might be. Rocks are no sharper in the dark.' \[Peel will take 'Crowns' and give you two books of unpredictable nature and origin. He won't leave until his other business is concluded.]
