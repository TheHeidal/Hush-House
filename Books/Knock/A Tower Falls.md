# Summary
The phonograph is packaged in glossy amethyst purple card with the words A TOWER FALLS in nine languages on both sides. There is no other identifying information at all.
# Reading
A recording of uncertain origin: inexplicably compelling poetry recorded by a speaker with a rasping, rumbling, impossibly deep voiceâ€¦ in the language called [[Vak]], which probably isn't spoken by more than a few dozen living scholars.
# Read
The poem speaks of a four-winged war, a four-mouthed king, a four-rayed sun, a four-cornered stone. It speaks of a tide-washed hunger of the heart; it speaks, lastly, of its own conclusion, when it might, might, might be spoken in dreams before [[the Deep Door]], by a Messenger of Histories...
# Speculation
This... might talk about [[the Intercalate]]? A four-rayed sun could be the [[the Sun-in-Splendour]] and his four children.
A tide-washed hunger of the heart... [[the tide]]?
Counterpart to [[A Tower Rises]]
