# Summary
[[Thirza Blake]] discusses ways 'to keep Wood-things out of trouble, and Mansus-things in it.'
# Reading
Thirza is irritatingly light on specifics, insisting above all that the duties of an adept are the duties of a host, and that a conjured spirit should be kept in as luxurious a vessel as possible.
# Read
Thirza notes the similarities between the [[Lantern-long]] habit of '[[scrining]]' - returning to the physical world, despite their absence of a body, by entering a [[mirrors (theme)|mirror]] or light - and [[Poemander]]'s techniques of confining Mansus-long to mirrors. She wonders whether Poemander himself might be lured to visit Hush House if provided with a sufficiently alluring scrine.
