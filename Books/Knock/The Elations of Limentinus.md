# Summary
The second volume of [[Abbot Geffrey]]'s hypothetical theological debates in the Socratic mode.
# Reading
'If Janus were an Hour, [[Limentinus]] might be counted among his Names, but Janus has never passed that threshold, and so Limentinus is notâ€¦'
# Read
Geffrey discusses 'the signs upon the Threshold', drawing comparisons between the duties of guest and host, and the status accorded to Hours and other powers who dwell in, are permitted in, or are forbidden access to the House of the Sun. (It was of course Geffrey who later invited censure by giving sanctuary to [[Natan of Regensburg]], in an age when the Jews were by royal order unwelcome anywhere in the kingdom.)
