# Summary
> [[Fr. Stanislav John Schaller|Father Stanislav John Schaller]] writes of the means and limitation of passage between the orders of the Mansus - [[Know]], [[Long]], [[Names]], [[Hours]]. Unusually, Father John has written this book in Fucine - for, he says, especial secrecy.
# Reading
> He speaks <i>very</i> cautiously of the exceptions that can sometimes be made to the edicts of Chancel and Calyptra, and hints at the means by which he successfully returned a Lantern-long to flesh...
# Read
> Schaller mentions most cautiously of all that he has been permitted to see a book that speaks more deeply on the matter, but that it was surrendered 'into the shadow of a covenant-stone of the Watchman's Tree.' It can be retrieved if 'the ninety-ninth wink is reserved under the Edicts Liminal.'
# Notes
Contains a hint on how to find [[The Three and the Three (St Chiavi Manuscript)]].

# Author's Commentary
> 'I remember this - '
> 'I'm surprised that it's found its way here... but that's Hush House, I suppose. May I refresh my memory? I remember that I wrote about the Galmier business - not as cautiously as I might have...'

> 'That law I will not name aloud - the law of the three - it can be defied. It is rarely wise to attempt that defiance. The penalty of failure is paid by one - but the penalty of success, by many. I would ask you, Librarian, to remember that, when you decide how to address yourself to Eternity. But I already have faith in your judgement. Thank you for the loan of the book.'
