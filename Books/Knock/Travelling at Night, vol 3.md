# Summary
The annotated dream-journals of [[Christopher Illopoly]], sometimes called 'the only readable occultist': literate, entertaining, bewildering.
# Reading
Illopoly's disquisitions on fire and [[the Unburnt God]] are interrupted by passages of distractingly erotic poetry addressed to '[[Teresa Galmier|Baldomera]]'.
# Read
To reach [[the Stag Door]], I believe that all you really need is to want something enough. But I've never wanted anything that much, except of course Baldomera, and I'm very much afraid that the knot in the story is this: what Baldomera wants is the Stag Door. But here's something I learnt in [[Persia]]. Perhaps it'll teach you what *you* want.'
