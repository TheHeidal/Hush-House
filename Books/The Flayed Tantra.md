# Summary
> This Tantra is recorded as being spoken by an enigmatic individual identified as '[[Dr Arun Peel|Peel]]', with many of the qualities of the mythological [[naga]]. The Flayed Tantra played a notable part in [[Alexander Sparrow]]'s paranoid pamphleteering.
# Reading
> 'Peel' was numbered among the [[Great Hooded Princes]], but it breaks with its brethren and followed [[the Thunderskin]] in the endless dance.
# Read
> Once Peel had peeled itself, it had the ink it needed to write the Tantra. It had to face the wrath of its fellows. Here is the invocation it used to fend them off.

# 'Undiplomatic, Librarian -'
> 'Every one of us still living - we all shed histories as a snake casts its skin. And I cast this history off long ago. I have no wish - no wish at all - to revisit it.'
