# Summary
> Blessings and invocations of [[the Triple Knot]] recorded at a sanctuary in [[Cyprus]] notable for its weavers, sculptors, and gardeners.
# # Reading
> 'The roots go deep. The knots remainâ€¦'
# Read
> The final invocation is one for the 'Restoration of the Roots', to be spoken before an altar of the Triple Knot - but, puzzlingly, it should not be spoken by any priestess of the Knot, or even by one who has been initiated into their Mysteries.
