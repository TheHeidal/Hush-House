# Summary
In the most notorious translation of the Leonine Tantra, [[Ashley Phillips]] is listed as the translator, but their existence is explicitly denied in the prologue. This confusion is characteristic of books which mention the [[Great Hooded Princes]].
# Reading
The Tantra describes, elliptically, the Great Hooded Princes and the multitudinous ways in which they influenced wars against foreign invaders of [[the Land of the Great River]], 'although in a sense they were also invaders'
# Read
[[Lions]] can be created, not as children are created, nor as words are created, but as weapons are created. The Great Hooded Princes learnt to create lions from their spyings on the affairs of the Hours, and not all lions now serve [[The Lionsmith|the Golden General]].'
