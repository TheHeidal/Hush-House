# Summary
> [[Hieronymus Pseudo-Hypnerotomachus]] wrote this furious screed about the sinister influence of  [[the Sisterhood of the Knot]] on his own [[The Church of the Unconquered Sun|Church of the Unconquered Sun]]\.
# Reading
> Hieronymus claims that the powers served by the Sisterhood of the Knot made an arrangement: [[the Thunderskin]] loved [[the Malachite|the Yew]], and [[the Red Grail|the Grail]] destroyed him, as restitution for the destruction of [[the Horned-Axe|the Axe]]'s loved ones. Hieronymus' writing becomes incoherent with rage at this point.
# Read
> Hieronymus recovers his composure, eventually, to describe how the Thunderskin entered the Mansus through [[the Peacock Door]]. This, Hieronymus insists, is 'abomination upon abomination: but then that most abominable of Doors has always been an abomination.'
