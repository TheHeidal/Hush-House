# Summary
> [[Omar, the Blaze]], spent seven years manning a lighthouse in [[Tyre]], in atonement for the extinguishing of [[a sacred flame]]. By the end of his stint, he was so terrified of fire that he could not stand to share a room with a candle. This work was written in partial penance.
# Reading
> Omar claims that the Hour called [[the Watchman|Watchman]] is both a [[gods-from-flesh|god-who-was-flesh]] - an Hour who was mortal - and also a [[Gods-from-Glory|god-from-Light]] - an Hour who descended from the Glory - but adds, finally, that the Watchman's origin is triple, and that 'in essence, he is [[amber]].'
# Read
> The Watchman, according to Omar, was once another Hour entirely, who ascended into [[the Glory]] to escape efforts by other Hours to send him to [[Nowhere]]. It may be that Omar's sense of persecution creeps into the narrative at this point: certainly it grows less coherent, and the last part is devoted to attempts to prove that eyes, eggs and the Sun are all in some sense conjunct.
