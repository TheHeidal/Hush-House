# Summary
A dire bestiary of the horrors to be found in mirrors. This is a recent edition of a third century text by '[[Poemander]]'.
# Reading
# Read
The virgins/[[Maid-in-the-Mirror|maidens of the mirror]] favour orchids. The [behindlings?] favour the rhododendron. Cut flowers of either nature should not be placed before polished bronze.' An appendix contains a rite which might be used to summon some of these entities, although the details of its use are not made clear.
