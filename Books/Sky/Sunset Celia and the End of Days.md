# Summary
> An [[House of Lethe|Obliviate]] adept identified only as '[[the Emiliano]]' rants desperately about the part [[Sunset Celia]] played in [[the Intercalate]], as 'the proxy of the Sun'.
# Reading
> Now she walks behind [[the Watchman]], but did she always? She has many of the characteristics of a [[Maid-in-the-Mirror]], after all. In older texts she has been called Caelia the Elagabaline. Perhaps she was [[Elagabalus|his]] daughter? Perhaps [[Tryphon]]'s sister? Perhaps, like the Watchman himself, she is like a shadow cast by two candles.'
# Read
> What must be revealed, will be revealed. Our Order's root is tainted, but its branches flourish beneath the shelter of [[the Watchman's Tree|the Watchman's greater Tree]]. I shall invoke its rites before[[ the Chancel]], [[the Cruciate]], and [[the Rode]]. I shall write a final History. Or another shall write it for me.'

# Notes & Speculations
This book might explain why the Vaults are beneath [[Hush House]]!
