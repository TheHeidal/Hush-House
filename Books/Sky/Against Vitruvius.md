# Summary
A fourteenth-century treatise on esoteric mechanics and parahydraulics by [[Abbot Ranulph]], best known now as a mason-architect.
# Reading
Ranulph describes how he tested some of these techniques in the construction of [[The Long Tower|The Winter Tower]] (now called the Long Tower). He admits to unexpected consequences…
# Read
Ranulph mentions that the tower of [[Ely Cathedral]] collapsed around the time the Winter Tower was completed… although he stops short of suggesting that one was the cause of another. 'A tower falls, a tower rises,' is all he'll commit to.
