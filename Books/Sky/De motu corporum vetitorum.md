# Summary
>The author rejoices in the name of '[[Abelard Hubris]]', and the title might be translated as 'On the Forbidden Motions of Bodies' - evidently a reference to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s 'De Motu Corporem', published some twenty years previously.
# Reading
>Hubris's thesis: that stars, planets and other bodies are the proxies or even essences of the Hours, and that conjunctions and occlusions reveal the outcome of Hour-intrigues in the Mansus.
# Read
>Hubris declares that [[the Great Comet]] of 1577 was the physical embodiment of the Hour named [[the Madrugad|Madrugad]]; that It disintegrated but its fragments gravitate to bone-marrow, where they can be located even now. He insists that [[Ouranoscopy|Ouranoscopic]] techniques can be used with [[Essential Periost]] and sufficient Winter to create a '[[Year-Tally|talisman gerifugic]]'.
