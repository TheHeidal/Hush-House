# Summary
An anonymous prison diary written by a dreamer convicted of '[[Mansus-dreaming|oneiric irresponsibility]]' and confined to [[the Cucurbit]].
# Reading
The prisoner is plainly terrified and bewildered by their situation, and has been unable to wrangle a coherent explanation out of anyone. But the dreams keep coming, and they keep writing them downâ€¦
# Read
[[Snow (thing)|Snow]]; broken [[mirrors]]; half-heard [[sky music]]; flowers of [[The White Flower|white]], [[The Red Flower|red]] and [[the Black Flower|black]]; a blood-streaked winter [[dawn]]... the most notorious signifiers of oneiric risk, fantastically vivid and detailed. No wonder they were locked up. Their final recorded dream is of a '[[Worms|worm]]-jewel' beneath Brancrug Isle, which they open with a key carved from their finger-bone.

[[Sights & Sensations]]

[[Bittersweet Certainty]]

# Speculations
Probably they are dreaming about the [[Rowenarium]] and [[The Keys of Dream]].
Snow, mirrors, and sky music might map to the three flowers of [[the Watchman's Tree]], and both could be a reflection of [[Calyptra]].
