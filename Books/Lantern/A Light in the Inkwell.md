# Summary
[[Musgrave Dewulf|Musgrave]], fourth of the Dewulf line, writes tentatively about the '[[Covenant of Brancrug]]' and the legacy of the sacred inks he calls '[[encaustum terminale|encausta revelationia]]'.
# Reading
Words are of the First Importance. So the [[Book of Suns]] teaches. But do not Words require Ink? And is the Inkwell not then the [[birth|Womb]] of Words?'
# Read
Musgrave identifies '[[the Ichor Auroral]]' as the mother of the encaustum [[Porphyrine]]. He adds that it would be blasphemous to describe the origins of the Ichor itself, although a scrawled marginal note suggests a later reader thought Musgrave was only hiding his ignorance beneath a cloak of piety.
