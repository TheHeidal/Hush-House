# Summary
> Formulae and instructions invoking Moth, Lantern and - exceptionally, paradoxically - the liminal and theoretical Hour called [[the Chandler]]. The author is anonymous, admitting only that they are 'one who is not yet nameless.'
# Reading
> The author makes a passionate argument that the Hour named Chandler is in fact the oldest, even though he does not exist, because he is - supposedly - the culminating event of a plan that precedes even Grail and Moth.
# Read
> 'Where the Chandler has passed, the understandings of [[the Colonel]] and [[the Lionsmith]] will wrench open truth. Where the Chandler will pass, Moth will pass before him.'
# Speculation
This references [[the Cucurbit#Gaol Cellar]] being able to be opened with [[Disciples of the Scar]] or [[Disciplines of the Hammer]]
