# Summary
An account by '[[Mistress White-Flower]]' of the [[alchemy|alchemical]] techniques favoured by [[the House of York]], also identified with the '[[Dawn]] Road'. These techniques failed to bring them victory in [[the War of the Roads]], but are 'not to be discounted'.
# Reading
The author asserts proudly that the Dawn Road ends in [[the Second Dawn]]; and hints darkly that the downfall of the House of York was 'Grail-sabotage'.
# Read
'Mistress White-Flower' urges a 'History of [[Uzult]]', where the Second Dawn may come to pass. She identifies Xanthotic Essence as Uzult's predecessor; she explains that with sufficient Lantern, [[Bitterblack Salts]] can be Purified to [[Xanthotic Essence]], and [[Iotic Essence]] can be Exalted to Xanthotic Essence.
