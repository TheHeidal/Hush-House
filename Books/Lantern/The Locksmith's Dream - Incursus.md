# Summary
> The fifth (and final?) volume of [[Teresa Galmier]]'s notorious work, which began as an examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans but became an account of her own occult journey. This volume was never published nor, apparently, even written.
# Reading
> "[[The Law]] goes back all the way to [[gods-from-stone|Stone]]: [[the Ligeian Club#The Keys of Dream|the keys]] cannot be held or owned. This had, I believe, the unexpected consequence that those outside the law may hold and own them. But even they cannot keep them. And of course a Key is no more physical than a spirit. But a spirit may be housed in a body, and I have touched a Key with my own hands."
# Read
> "So [[the Ligeian Club|the Ligeians]] hold the keys. I had thought the Ligeians only - 'only' - old and powerful transgressors of [[the Crime of the Sky]]. But I begin to understand that the Crime of the Sky is more even that it seems. And why a [[The Twins|Twin]], who unite what is not to be divided, might accept a Ligeian as her Name..."

Found in the [[Gaol Hall]]
# Speculation
This is a huge amount of lore about [[the Ligeian Club]].
