# Summary
An uncharacteristically poignant meditation by the Edge-long [[Twrog]] of Meirionnydd, who later came to Hush House under a variety of other names, often in search of some sort of fight.
# Reading
'If Light were not silent, it would be Music. If Music were visible, it would be Lightâ€¦'
# Read
Each day's light, Twrog suggests, is faintly touched by the light of every past day; so in the light of every present day, we may begin to understand something of days to come. At least, this appears to be his conclusion, but he stops in mid-sentence, apparently having lost patience with act of writing, or possibly been ambushed.
# Speculation
This might be [[Torgue]]?
