# Summary 
> The grand labour of [[Kalle]], an ascetic poet writing at the court of [[the Shadowless Empire|the Shadowless Kings]].
# Reading
> Kalle's verses are brief, obscure, and often dominated by images of violence. 'A star is a pin-prick, but the Sun is a wound.'
# Read
> It's always possible to be deader,' Kalle states. '[[The Watchman]] goes before; none but seven may go after.' 'Yet surely we are born to [[the Glory]] as the sparks fly upwards.'
# Speculation
"The Watchman goes before" reminds me of [[Rite of the Watchman's Sorrow]]
