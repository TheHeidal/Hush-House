# Summary
>Lord [[Franklin Bancroft]] was initiated into the arts of [[the Flowermaker]] by the 'rose-witch' [[Fionna Ayrshire]]. He rose to become a Society provider of occult services and secret pleasures, before his abrupt disappearance in 1790.
# Reading
>Bancroft seems to have been a talented adept, but devoted his energies to frustratingly whimsical projects: arranging 'grape-fetching races' between Mansus-spirits, teaching [[Percussigants]] to juggle, and conjuring storms of imaginary blossoms for the rose-witch Ayrshire, who resolutely refused ever to couple with him. Bancroft spends twenty pages bemoaning this last.
# Read
>The Mantra here recorded is a high and exacting magic which can be used to pledge one's spirit to the Watchman, beginning an ascent to the House. Bancroft boasts of his ability to recite it when in his cups. He also had it set to music for a perfomance with [[fireworks]] at [[Vauxhall Gardens]].
