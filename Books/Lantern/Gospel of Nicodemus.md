# Summary
> An apocryphal account of the works and experiences of [[Jesus Christ|the Shepherd Illuminate]] by one of his supposed companions.
# Reading
> Inventori Lucis Soli Invicto Nuntio' reads the dedication - loosely translatable as 'I am the herald of [[the Sun Unconquerable|the Sun Unconquerable]], Light's Contriver'. This is a variation on the more usual 'invicto augusto', the declaration which united the eastern and western traditions of the Church Solar.
# Read
> The Shepherd Illuminate, the Virgin-Born, warns of [[the Intercalate|the Sun's Division]] but promises its ultimate reunification in the Second Dawn 'through the ministry of St [[Uzult]]'. <i>Uzult</i> is of course the ink of power used by Librarians of the Tree, but also venerated as a saint in some borderline heterodox solar traditions.
