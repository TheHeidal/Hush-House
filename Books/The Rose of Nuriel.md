# Summary
A volume of collected teachings of [[The Sisterhood of the Knot]], that arcane-contemplative order that existed in all histories, but in some was very powerful indeed. This was recorded by '[[Nuriel]]', and dedicated to [[Tryphon|St Tryphon]].
# Reading
St Tryphon, Nuriel explains, performed secret miracles in the name of '[[the Red Grail|She who Bleeds and Bears]]'' and '[[the Horned-Axe|She who Opens]]'. Thus St Tryphon opened the way to the House of the Sun; thus St Tryphon underwent the Great Birth, an ascension to immortality.
# Read
St Tryphon began his ascension by passing the '[[the Stag Door|Horned Door]]'. St Tryphon continued his ascension by learning the '[[Invocation Thiatic]]' - which Nuriel does not here record, on account of its extreme holiness. And, Nuriel explains grimly, to achieve the Seven Marks of the Great Birth, St Tryphon consumed 'those whose soul had left them, and even those in whom the soul remained.'
# Speculation
Tryphon seems to be some kind of Grail-Long, and undergoes the Grail ascension of Cultist Simulator.
A counterpart to '[[The Rose of Waznei]]'
