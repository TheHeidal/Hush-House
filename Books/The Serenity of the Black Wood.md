# Summary
> An allegorical history of the [[House of Lethe]], which it is here implied was inspired by [[the Vagabond|the Centipede]]. 'Sereno Blackwood' is an occult alias to this day.
# Reading
> The Proverbial Footloose' gathers travellers in a wood, and leads them through, but abandons them part-way. They find themselves beset by 'glorious monsters'.
# Read
> The travellers discover they can survive if they close their eyes (they adopt a closed eye as their sign) and that they can go unnoticed if they drink from the clear cold streams. They never forget 'that proverbial footloose, the Centipede' but they never forgive her either.
# Speculation
This is some House of Lethe propaganda. References [[the Spring]] at Port Noon.
