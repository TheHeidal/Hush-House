# Summary
> An anonymous confessional account of unsanctioned activities by [[the Nuns of St Brandan's|the nuns]] of [[St Brandan's Abbey|St Brandan's]]. The title is a Henavek phrase that might be translated as 'the spirit flees the shadowed places.'
# Reading
> The author writes guiltily of her dealings with [[hill-children]] and [[the Carapace Cross|Carapace]]-relics - she suggests she herself has a connection with one of the Carapace-kinds. Most of these dealings are trivial, but she claims to have arranged the death of the Marcher Lord William de Braose, called [[Black William]]...
# Read
> De Braose' wife, [[Eva de Braose|Eva]], evidently seeks the Abbey's help to free her from her hated husband. Subsequently he is found in the bed-chamber of the wife of Llywelyn the Great, Prince of the Welsh, while attempting to negotiate the marriage of his daughter (also Eva) to Llywelyn's son. Llywellyn takes this badly, de Braose is hanged, the elder Eva inherits his estates and makes a substantial endowment to St Brandan's. In the author's telling, de Braose was 'innocent of all but cruelty' and the adulterer found in the bed-chamber was a shape-changing '[[Undergoer|undergoer]]'...
