# Summary
> Herein, the seventeenth-century mystic and antiquarian [[Claude Hersault]] describes the '[[the Bounds|Bounds]]' or 'Underplaces' on the borders of dream. He warns that they shift over time.
# Reading
> The walls of the Mansus,' Hersault begins, 'are the size of starlight.' Many of his directions are equally unhelpful, but common relationships do emerge.
# Read
> A picaresque account of a journey through nightmare, interspersed with what might be partial rites. 'On the eighteenth Ascent is the bud. On the thirty-sixth Ascent, the blossom.'
# Speculation
in #CultSim , you need 36 of an aspect to ascend.
