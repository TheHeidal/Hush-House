# Summary
A calligraphic manual of [[Ramsund]] which employs as exemplar-text [[Farid ud-Din]]'s '[[Conference of the Birds]]'. \[This book houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
# Reading
At noon [[the Sun-in-Splendour|the Sun]] moves like the beating of a wing. At sunset he sends [[Sunset Celia|the herald-child]] with her candle. At midnight, he sends the wind that extinguishes the candle-flameâ€¦'
# Read
Commentary, illustrations and interleavings carry revelations never intended in the original: a sense of history, and the senses of Histories.

# Notes
Has the [[Birdsong]] icon on the spine.
