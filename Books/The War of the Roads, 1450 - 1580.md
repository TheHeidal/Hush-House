# Summary
[[Willis-Ford]] describes [[the War of the Roads]], an event in a History other than our own, in detail. But numerous pages have been removed; the name of the publisher is blacked out; and an ominous slip stapled to the cover explains that Willis-Ford has been 'excised'.
# Reading
In this past, a score or more of Longs were made. They brokered peace with [[the Forge of Days]], long enough to set England on a path of early conquest and eventual destruction. The Forge itself devoured the greatest among them.
# Read
The Royalty of England, according to Willis-Ford, became the [[the Sovereigns of the Leashed Flame]], destroying or transforming their enemies, conquering Europe, establishing grand cathedrals to [[St Spark]]. The alliance with the Forge begins to take its toll. The last few chapters are missing entirely.
