# Summary
The second volume of the meditations of [[Abbot Thomas]] of the Abbey of the Black Dove.
# Reading
Abbot Thomas speaks of his time as a raider, when his name was not Thomas but Toke, 'scything the sea, striving for plunder'â€¦
# Read
Abbot Thomas clearly regrets his 'storm-years', and much of the book is taken up with his thoughts on penitence; but there are hints also that he misses those years, and the companionship of his 'sword-brother, ship-brother' [[Trygve]].
