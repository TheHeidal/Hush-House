# Author's Commentary
> 'Ooh!'
> 'That publisher in [[Kerisham]]. I promised her if she did right by me, she'd never see me again. Well, dear, a promise is a promise, but a story is a story. If you let me touch that book, I promise I'll give it back.' 

> 'There you are, dear. A little lesson for you. And another little lesson for you later.'

 She did inflict the book with [[Keeperskin]]. Gross.
