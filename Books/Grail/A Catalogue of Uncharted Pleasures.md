# Summary
> [['The Dark Gentleman']] is the only, and rather grandiosely, identified author of this often-copied work.
# Reading
> Some pleasures,' the [[Grail Lore#Formula Voluptuous|Formulae Voluptuous]] attest, 'are so intense they can corrupt the laws of the physical world'. This text catalogues some of those instances.
# Read
> Birth occurs at the conjunction of pleasure and torment. So the first Forbidden Acts of [[the Forge of Days|the Forge]] birthed sparks of delight which took root in the Glory or in Nowhere: who can say? So the seeds of [[the Flowermaker]] were planted, though for long years he was nothing but an unfulfilled ache.
