# Summary
> The second volume of a compilation of quasi-Rosicrucian allegories, supposedly by [[Robert Fludd]]. This is in the original Latin.
# Reading
> Fludd, or pseudo-Fludd, suggests alignments between the alchemical tradition of rubedo and the older Grail traditions, through [[the Pine-Knight]]'s quest for the Cinnabar Cup.
# Read
> Seek the Cup in the birthing-bed,' the Pine-Knight is told. The Midwife at the birthing-bed, to his amazement, is the Mountain-Mother. In a fit of awe, he both gelds and flays himself. The Vigilant Storm bursts joyfully from the remains.
# Speculation
"The Cinnabar Cup" is an allusion to [[the Red Grail]], and "the Mountain-Mother" is one of the her titles as [[Cybele]].
"The Vigilant Storm" is likely [[the Thunderskin]]. It is unclear if this story refers to [[Marsyas]]'s becoming a Name of the Red Grail or becoming the Thunderskin.
