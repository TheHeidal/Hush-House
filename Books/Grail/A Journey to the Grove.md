# Summary
[[Black Elie]], who much later became [[Damascene Matriarch]] of  [[The Sisterhood of the Knot|the Sisterhood of the Knot]], recounts her journey to [[the Grove of the Green Immortals|the Grove of Green Immortals]].
# Reading
In the Grove, Elie meets with an entity identified as '[[Three Faces, Nine Colours]]' - who may have become her lover.
# Read
Three Faces is a name of [[the Applebright]], the Nowhere Hour of youth, healing and mutation. It offers Elie a form of eternal youth to take back West with her, which she rejects for certain reasons. She does promise, however, to renew their acquaintance 'in the season when the Applebright is [[The Twins|the Witch]]' - not from sentiment, but rather grandly, to ensure the continuity of the Histories.
