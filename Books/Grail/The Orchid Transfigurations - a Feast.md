# Summary
A compilation of quasi-Rosicrucian allegories, supposedly by [[Robert Fludd]]. This is in the original Latin.
# Reading
The illustrations are certainly striking. They flush the skin and glow beneath the eyelids after the book is closed.
# Read
'We must devour to be devoured. We cannot be undevoured, as we cannot be unborn.'
