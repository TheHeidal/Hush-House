# Summary
> The libretto of a lost opera concerning the contest between Apollo and [[Marsyas]], and its tragic outcome. The librettist is identified only by their initials.
# Reading
>In the original myth, Marsyas lost the musical contest and was flayed by Apollo, who later regretted it. In this version, Marsyas' skin has a further history...
# Read
> The Skin of Marsyas gives oracles, and is later smuggled to [[Phrygia]], where the priestesses of [[Cybele]] use it for a drum. At the climax, the striking of the drum drives would-be violators of the priestess to suicidal madness. The opera ends with a wistful hymn from the youngest priestess on the beauty of mountain pines.
