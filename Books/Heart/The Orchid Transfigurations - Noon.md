# Summary
The third volume of a compilation of quasi-Rosicrucian allegories, supposedly by [[Robert Fludd]]. This is in the original Latin.
# Reading
A long dialogue between the Mountain-Mother and the Vigilant Storm describes the ways in which both mountains and storms end, and the protections they use against those ends.
# Read
'But we must use the knife,' said the Lion-Throned One, 'the noose, the flame, the Waking Word, against those who have passed [[the Tricuspid Gate|the Three-Valved Door]]. And so none may pass: that is our Law, and the Law of the Sun.'
# Speculation
The Vigilant Storm could be [[the Thunderskin]]? The Lion-Throned One is certainly [[The Lionsmith]].
