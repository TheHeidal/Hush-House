# Summary
> Descriptions of the '[[Asclepian Mysteries]]', reproduced by one '[[Rylee Grese]]' from - supposedly - a much older text. It's unlikely to be genuine, but it makes a reference to 'The House without Walls and its Wood' right there in the prologue.
# Reading
> This is very obviously not an antique text. At the very least, it has been badly mutilated. But it contains substantial intriguing material: especially, a persuasive comparison of the House without Walls, without doors to the human body, with its many portals.
# Read
> The direction of Death is down,' the book explains. '[[The Peacock Door]] has been considered a rent, or an abrasion, but in some respects is more like a mouth - if not a more treasured point of entry.' Discussions of the Doors include a rite which may conjure creatures through those doors, although key incantations are missing.
