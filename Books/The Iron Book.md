# Summary
A manual of [[House of Lethe|the Ordo Limiae]], an order of quasi-immortals who maintained a secret enclave at the source of the river [[Limia]], in the Roman province of [[Hispania Gallaecia]]. This manual was compiled by one [[Melerai Yivni]], who claims to have travelled to join the Ordo from '[[the Crossroads of the Waters]]'.
# Reading
Members of the Ordo took an oath, [[the Iron Chain]], that required them to remain hidden from the world. This manual includes presumably long-obsolete addresses and pass-phrases that could have been used to find the Ordo's contact in the town of [[Iria]].
# Read
The final part of the manual describes the punishments for Ordo members who break their oath of secrecy. This includes an invocation used to summon the spirit called [[King Crucible]] as an agent of vengeance. Yivni cautions that this must be a last resort when the oathbreaker would otherwise go unpunished: summoning King Crucible might draw the personal attention of the Forge of Days. (A marginal note suggests, in any case, that King Crucible, 'in a most transcendent Sulk of Sulks', no longer leaves the Mansus.)
