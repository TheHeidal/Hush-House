# Summary
> The third and last volume of the meditations of [[Abbot Thomas]] of [[the Abbey|the Abbey of the Black Dove]].
# Reading
> Abbot Thomas speaks of the coming death he hears in the sound of the waves, but rejoices that his blood will water the 'Egg of the Moon' - by which he seems to mean the future.
# Read
> The last chapter was dictated, not written, by Abbot Thomas. When Thomas' old sword-brother [[Trygve]] returned to raid the Abbey, Thomas had broken his monastic oaths and taken up arms to defend the abbey. The two had both been mortally wounded. Thomas' last words are '[[the Wheel]] turns; the Moon sleeps.'
