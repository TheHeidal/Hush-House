# Summary
> A treatise on eggs, light, and optics by [[Abbess Melancthe]], dazzlingly illuminated with renderings of the Abbess' visions.
# Reading
> The book is unexpectedly challenging to read. The bright glitter of the gold-leaf illuminations acquires a migrainous quality; the eye aches and tiresâ€¦
# Read
> This is, most likely, the 'certain vivid book' that Melancthe once sent to [[Gunnhild]], daughter of [[King Harold]], which provoked in her 'a dream of eyes' but also caused her to begin to lose her sight (until she was healed by the saint-bishop [[Wulfstan]]). To complete it is a kind of test. Its double thesis, at last, seems to be that the Sun is either an eye or an egg; and so [[the Second Dawn]] will be either its opening, or its hatching.
