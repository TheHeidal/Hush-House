# Summary
Ostensibly an eighteenth-century [[fireworks]] manual, but with some exotic ingredient choices and a substantial section on '[[teframancy]]', divination from ashes.
# Reading
The text takes as its theme the motto of [[the Society of the Noble Endeavour]], ALITUR PROPRIIS IGNIS CINERIBUS -  'a fire by its own ashes is nourished', and uses this as a way into discussions of alchemical techniquesâ€¦
# Read
A surprisingly casual final section mentions that [[iotic essence]], 'the root of the Great and [[Orpiment Exultant|Exultant Ink Orpimental]]', can be refined with enough [[Forge]] from a variety of liquids.

[[Memory - Foresight]]
