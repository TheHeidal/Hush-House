# Summary
A miscellany of the funerary prayers, ceremonies and hymns of [[the Church of the Unconquered Sun]], which was ascendant in the [[the Third History|Third]] and [[the Fourth History|Fourth]] Histories. It schismed during the Intercalate, when the Sun was divided, and has not survived as a significant force.
# Reading
The Church revered [[the Sun-in-Splendour]] before it was divided -but even while it was still whole, its later selves were recognised as its Names. [[The Madrugad]], of course, presided over death and the passage into the House.
# Read
The White Ceremony was spoken to honour the Madrugad, at funerals held in the chilly space before dawn. The text cautions that all blades should remain sheathed while the Ceremony is spoken, 'lest the corpse be not quiet.'
