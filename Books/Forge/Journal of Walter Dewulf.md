# Summary
> [[Walter Dewulf]], 3rd Baron Brancrug, was grandson of [[Thomas Dewulf|Thomas]], son of the disgraced [[Giles Dewulf|Giles]], who eloped with '[[Hafren Waters|Pale Hafren]]'. The Dewulf line might have ended here if [[Ernestine Peterhans|the Seneschale Ernestine]] - by then over eighty - had not managed to reconcile Thomas with a dying Giles.
# Reading
> Walter, though nominally siding with the Parliamentarians, manages to stay out of the war... but in 1642, his son [[Bryan Dewulf|Bryan]] runs away on the night of his sixteenth birthday and joins the Royalist army. He is captured and returned to his father, who pleads for mercy and gives his parole for his son's good behaviour.
# Read
> In 1648, Bryan runs away again to join a Royalist uprising. Walter writes of news that Bryan has been seen on the field of battle at Gear Camp, but that his fate is yet unknown. Walter writes one last entry about his fear for his son and the future of his family.
> There the journal ends; but the extensive account of Walter's collaboration with the architect [[Gregory Wheelock]] includes usefully esoteric information.
