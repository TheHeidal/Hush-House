# Summary
> The antiquarian and nyctodromist [[Ambrose Westcott]] writes of the 'dangers of doors', with particular reference to a house in [[the bounds]] named '[[Treowen]]'.
# Reading
> No doubt they have come to regret the ambitions of their [[Grand Ascent|the Winding Stair]]; even now in Treowen, a silver sea is unwisely visible from a rash windowâ€¦'
# Read
> Westcott explains that the [[Wheelocks]], the 'charge-holders of [[Treowen]]', have had recourse to dramatic measures to prevent [[oneiric irresponsibility|oneiric encroachment]]., removing the entire top floor of the building. 'Nevertheless,' he writes, 'the business of [[the House of the Moon|the Moon-Hall]] has begun to touch the other business of the house...'

# Speculation:
[[Treowen]] and it's connection to [[the House of the Moon]] is also mentioned in [[On the Winding Stair]]
