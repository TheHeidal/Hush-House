# Summary
The phonograph is packaged in glossy card the bright pink of a dog-rose, with the words A TOWER RISES in nine languages on both sides. There is no other identifying information at all.
# Reading
A recording of uncertain origin: inexplicably compelling poetry recorded by a speaker with a high, sweet voice that scales up beyond human hearingâ€¦ in the language called [[Vak]], which probably isn't spoken by more than a few dozen living scholars.
# Read
The poem speaks of [[the Wheel]] that turns, [[the Seven-Coils|the Coil]] that turns, [[the Tide]] that returns, [[the Egg Unhatching|Egg]] that returns; it speaks of a cloven sky, an opened heart, a dream of glittering eyes; speaks, lastly, of its own conclusion, when it might, might, might be spoken in dreams before [[the Deep Door]], by a Messenger of Histories...
# Speculation
First it lists four of the [[gods-from-stone]].

A cloven sky recalls [['Self-Born']], and [[Sky]] more generally?
