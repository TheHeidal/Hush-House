# Summary
> [[Sister Isabel]], then [[Precentress]] of [[the Abbey|the Abbey-Church of St Brandan's]], engages in dialogues with a [[Heart-long]] of a kind called '[[duendrazon]]' that has taken partial possession of her body.
# Reading
> The duendrazon, like all its kind, usually dwells in the Mansus but can enter the physical world by manifesting as music, and take possession of a willing - or semi-willing - mortal who hears and loves that musicâ€¦ like Isabella.
# Read
> Isabella records her dreams of the high Mansus, where she is accorded the duendrazon's status and titles. In return, the duendrazon enjoys what it calls 'caesura' - a welcome oblivion. 'Our mostly-blessing is that we may never cease - except <i>in caesurae</i>'. There is something more that Isabella refers to as the '[[caesura magna]]', but she laments that her duendrazon will not tell her exactly what that might be.
