# Summary
> A recording of a 1911 attempt at a performance of 'Wings within Wings', the so-called Invisible Opera.
# Reading
> The singers complete <i>the Skewbald Aria</i>, <i>Beneath Our Skin</i>, and <i>A Rose in Miah</i> without incident; but the Invisible Opera is dedicated to [[Ferezeref the Magpie]], who delights in unexpected interruptions…
# Read
> The recording ends with a clamour of horrified voices, a grating metallic screech, and a soft brass buzzing that fades into burring silence…
# Speculation
A rose in Miah is almost certainly connected to [[The Affair of the Dappled Rose]].
