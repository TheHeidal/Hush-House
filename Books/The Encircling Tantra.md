# Summary
The explorer and entrepreneur [[T. Everett Duplantis]] once attempted to plunder the temple where this text was held. His fate is recorded in an appendix.
# Reading
The Encircling Tantra speaks of the Serpent Gate, that hungry portal sometimes known as [[the Spider's Door]], which is sacred to [[the Mother of Ants]], through which the [[Great Hooded Princes]] pass.
# Read
The tantra includes an invocation but cautions, helpfully, that the invocation is of insufficient power to reach the Serpent Gate from [[the Hunter's Gate]]. 'A road which has no destination is itself a destination,' it adds helpfully.
