# Summary
> [[Ninegala of Lagash]] discusses [[the Peacock Door]], the highest door available to mortals in the Mansus: 'a rent, an imperfection, an abrasion.'
# Reading
> Notably, the book is written in Vak, which by some accounts is another aspect of the Peacock Door itself. Ninegala addresses this by apologising courteously to the Door, and the language, at the end of every section.
# Read
> The Peacock Door did not exist - Ninegala says - in the days when the gods-from-stone entered the Mansus. They used [[The Hissing Key|the 'Fanged Key']] to open [[the Savage Door]], a door not usually available to mortals. 'Speech, as the initiates of [[Chione]] would have it, is a wound. I fear that through that wound, the blood of the Mansus flows even now, and that one day Speech will be an end to Dream. I fear that; but I fear the alternative far more.'
# Notes
Ninegala of Lagash sound suspiciously close to [[Nina Lagasse]], who painted a painting called [['Abydos Uncrowned (Painting)']]. Abydos and Chione are both referenced in [[Chione at Abydos]].
Speech the Wound is one of the Speech [[Determinations]].
