# Read
Gregory evidently succeeds in opening a way to something he calls the '[[the House of the Moon|Moon-Hall]]', but here his account becomes erratic. He insists that in the Moon-Hall [[the Horned-Axe|the Horned-Axe]] is still an Edge-power; he hopes for an '[[the Corrivality|eternal rival]]', but cannot find the one he needs. The narrative is increasingly interspersed with chess notations, and ends abruptly.
