# Summary
> Fiendishly complex, weirdly distorted illustrations of 'congress and anatomy' by the haunted visionary painter [[Niels Frederik Malskær]].
# Reading
> Malskær illuminates the evolutions of the Names of [[the Red Grail|the Grail]] with unfortunate clarity. It seems that a [[Thirstlies, Ivories and Lovelies#Lovely|Lovely]] who consumes an [[Thirstlies, Ivories and Lovelies#Ivories|Ivory]] becomes an Ivory. A Lovely who consumes a [[Thirstlies, Ivories and Lovelies#Thirstly|Thirstly]] becomes a Thirstly. A Lovely who consumes a Name of another Hour might take its place...
# Read
> In the penultimate illustration, a Lovely grapples with a fungoid knot that can only be a Name of [[the Crowned Growth]]. The Lovely's mouth and other portals gape wide, and the Growth-Name is already partially engulfed - but it seems that Malskær couldn't bring himself to illustrate the result, and the final illustration is only a scrawled, bloated obscurity.

> “The Sister-and-Witch is Cruciate, but the Witch-and-Sister is not. Even those powers that demand a conjunction are not always conjoined. When the Sister is Nowhere, does this mean Nowhere sits _in crucem_? “[^1]
