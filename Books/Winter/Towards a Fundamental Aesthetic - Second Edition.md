# Summary
> Or, 'The Refinements of Light'. [[Julian Coseley]] had never wanted or expected to write a second edition of [[Books/Towards a Fundamental Aesthetic|his masterwork]]... \[This book houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
# Reading
> Julian Coseley long regarded [[Solomon Husher]] as a charlatan. But his friend [[Nina Lagasse]] painted three paintings before her death in 1895â€¦ and these paintings apparently convinced Coseley to change his mind. With considerable irritation, he revised his magnum opus. 
# Read
> The perfect hegemony of the Hours is, perhaps, eternal. Coseley had always championed History rather than Eternity - the exceptions, limitations, contradictions of freedom. But Husher's and Lagasse's work convinced him to believe in the 'paradox of the eternal ending', a means in which perfection might be reconciled with freedom. He's not happy about it. This is perhaps the angriest book ever written in support of a peaceful philosophy of acceptance. But Coseley was always scrupulous about his conclusions.
# Notes
