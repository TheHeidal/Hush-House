# Summary
> Or, 'The House of Glass'. [[Julian Coseley]] considered this his masterwork. \[This book houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
# Reading
> Techniques for perception and analysis which permit invidious and apocalyptic conclusions. Probably the most assiduously suppressed book in history. The entire run was destroyed - even the presses were melted and dispersed - but the manuscript edition has survived.
# Read
> The perfect hegemony of the Hours is, perhaps, eternal. But Coseley proposes and describes 'Confinement Inescapable', aesthetic and optical techniques which might contain even an Hour, profoundly disrupting the order of the Mansus. He presents this as his own work, but there are hints here and there that he received inspiration or even assistance from the Nowhere-Hour named [[Snow (Hour)|Snow]].
