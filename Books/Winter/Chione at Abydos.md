# Summary
> A play dealing with the nine-year sojourn of a snow-goddess in the Thracian city of [[Abydos]], by '[[Apollo Fireweaver]]'. In English, published in 1892; purportedly from an older Greek text.
# Reading
> The entity called '[[Chione]]' arrives in a blizzard and demands the city gates are barred. As Abydos falls under her spell, the dead return, but do not speak...
# Read
> For eight years the city is a place of slow death, frosty ecstasy and silent beauty, but in the ninth year a Conspiracy of Shouts is mounted against the quiet that Chione demands. The conspirators open the city gates, and a scarred man comes to drag Chione out by the hair. Summer returns, but the conspirators die of remorse.
# Speculation
The Scarred Man is definitely [[The Colonel]]. Chione is definitely a winter entity. Is she [[Snow (Hour)]]?
