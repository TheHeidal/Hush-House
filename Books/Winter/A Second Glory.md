# Summary
The priest [[Juceh]] celebrates the extirpation of [[gods-from-stone|god-from-stone]], those Hours who preceded humanity.
# Reading
Juceh engages in an apologia for the destruction of the Hours: they were old, they were cowardly, they were vile, their time had passed, and it was the shining destiny of humankind to seize the House through glorious battle.
# Read
Juceh recounts how the Hour called [[the Seven-Coils|Seven-Coils]] was slain in battle by [[the Colonel]], how [[the Grail]] devoured the Hour called [[the Tide|Tide]], and how [[the Egg Unhatching]] 'fled like a coward'. He's quite vituperative about the Egg Unhatching. He warns darkly against its return.
