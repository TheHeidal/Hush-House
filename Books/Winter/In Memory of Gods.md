# Summary
> '[[The Barrowchild]]', a nameless [[Gaul|Gaulish]] adept who joined an organisation identified as the [[House of Lethe|Ordo Limiae]], writes regretfully of the destruction of the [[gods-from-stone|gods-who-were-stone]] - the Hours who preceded humanity.
# Reading
> The Barrowchild singles out [[The Colonel|the Scarred Tribune]], [[the Red Grail]], [[the Forge of Days|the Forge]] and [[the Moth]] for especial condemnation as murderers of the first gods. 'We live in the shadow of their crime', she writes, 'and we must evade it or repeat it.'
# Read
> The Barrowchild describes how the Grail drained the Hour called [[the Tide|Tide]], how the Moth 'usurped [[the Wheel]] from within', stealing its skin, and how the Forge first eclipsed then shattered [[the Flint|Flint]]. 'Perhaps these are glories,' she observes, 'but then it cannot be that Glory is merciful.'
