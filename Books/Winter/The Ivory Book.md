# Summary
> A manual of [[House of Lethe|the Ordo Limiae]], an order of quasi-immortals who maintained a secret enclave at the source of the river Limia, in the Roman province of Hispania Gallaecia. This manual was compiled by one [[Kurenai]], who claims to have fled 'the tyranny of [[Japan|the Chrysanthemum Throne]]' to cross the world and join the Ordo.
# Reading
> Members of the Ordo took an oath, [[House of Lethe#The Ivory Chain|the Ivory Chain]], not to have commerce with the Hours. Followed literally, this would be almost impossible for an adept, so the manual contains numerous clarifications, exceptions and processes of indulgence.
# Read
> Kurenai describes the Order's burial rites, which include spells to ensure - in theory - that the souls of dead Long are not given to the Hours. The Hour called [[the Elegiast|the Ivory Dove]], who memorialises and commemorates, is to be invoked, in secret, in these rites, 'for with that Hour we have made an understanding'.
# Notes
Kurenai fled from Japan, that's kind of neat
