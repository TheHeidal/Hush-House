# Summary
[[Julian Coseley]]'s epistolary treatise on 'matters [[Memory (theme)|memorial and mnemonic]]', addressed to his then-friend [[Claude Hersault]], the mystic and antiquarian.
# Reading
The book is partly a practical manual, expounding memory-palace-like techniques, and partly an exploration of 'Memory Rarefied' - modes in which sense or experience persist outside a mortal mind.
# Read
This is an early work, and by Coseley's standards it brims with optimism, even enthusiasm. If books, he suggests, are the memory that does not die, then 'perhaps with sufficient Endeavours, Memory's Murderer might be Contain'd'.
