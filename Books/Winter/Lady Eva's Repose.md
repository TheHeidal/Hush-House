# Summary
>A 'meditation' on the drowning of [[Eva Dewulf|Lady Eva Dewulf]] and [[Eva Dewulf's Grand-twins|her two grandchildren]], written in the years when the estate was abandoned by [[Father Theo]], once the Dewulf family chaplain, one of the few to remain on the Isle in those desolate years.
# Reading
>There are so many stories of her heritage, so many rumours of her persistence. We might easily choose to believe that the grand-twins escaped - even that they live yet beyond the sea - '
# Read
>Father Theo has come to believe that Eva sought an escape from a family curse - the 'pale heritage' of [[Hafren Waters]] her forebear, or the curse placed upon the line by the cunning-man [[Red William]] in the time of [[Hendrik Dewulf]]. He had begun by believing neither curse was real; but as the book concludes, he decides that he has determined to believe in them, rather than accept the three deaths as a futile tragedy. 'One does not so easily escape the long necessity of faith,' he concludes.

# Speculation
Twins and fleeing "Beyond the Sea" brings to mind [[The Twins]], especially as told in [[Two Wombs, One Heart]].
Beyond the Sea might be a reference to [[Ys]]
