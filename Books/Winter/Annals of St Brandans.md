# Summary
> Over a hundred years of [[the Abbey|the abbey]]'s annals, from 1230 to 1350.
# Reading
> Three events of particular interest are recorded: an endowment by [[Eva de Braose]], widow of the Marcher Lord Gwilym Ddu ('[[Black William]]), which enables an expansion of the Abbey; the construction of the Winter Tower, which is dedicated to [[the Madrugad]]; and the death 'by poisoning and Arts unsanctioned' of [[Abbess Nonna]]...
# Read
> After Abbess Nonna's death, the 'double foundation' [[Trials of st Brandan's|is dissolved]] and the monastery is reformed to accept only male novices. At this point the ink changes. The helpful scribe explains that for the new foundation, the Abbot has mandated [[Stargall Ink|stargall]], not [[Yewgall Ink|Yewgall]], ink. He outlines the differences (use of Inks of Containment techniques with a Sky, not Nectar, context) but doesn't trouble to explain why.
