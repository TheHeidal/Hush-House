# Summary
> [[The Velvet]] is the Hour of secrets; and so very little is known of the - [[Moth-long]]? [[Nectar-long]]? - who ascend to immortality under her auspices. But this book (by '[[Kitling's Friend]]') purports to be part cook-book, and part manual for immortality.
# Reading
> [[Kitling Ripe]] is the name usually given to the speechless 'but never silent' cat-thing that serves as a Name of the Velvet. Kitling Ripe, it seems, enjoys hunting immortals; and the Velvet is very fond of Kitling Ripe..
# Read
> The secret, it appears, is to arouse the Kitling's appetite enough to become her quarry, but not <i>quite</i> enough to be caught. The Velvet permits the game, since it culls immortals careless enough to attract attention, and keeps her Name happy. The author bemoans the loss of [[the Carapace Cross]]' [[savour-secret|savour-secrets]], which apparently were particularly tempting - but suggests decent spice-substitutes, which also happen to make for excellent pigeon-pie.
