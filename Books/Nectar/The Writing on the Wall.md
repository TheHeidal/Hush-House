# Summary
> The most delicious traditions of [[the Carapace Cross]], as recorded on the walls of the Mansus and transcribed into a book of ninety-nine pages by one known only as 'cc'. Although this book does not exist, it is read to a sleeper under certain very specific circumstances - and certain fragments jotted down on waking. \[This 'book' houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
# Reading
>'It was Hunger that made [[Worms]] of [[Dragons]] - when they consumed the corpses of Hours. Without the [[savour-secret]] of the Carapace, their hunger would not have been sufficientâ€¦'
# Read
>Here is outlined the savour-secret of the Carapace, which harnesses hunger to permit impossible hybridisations. With this secret, even the most potent and fundamental entities have devoured and been devoured. And this, no doubt, is why it's secret.

# Elucidate Enlightenment from an Earlier Era

If I know what I'm doing - or perhaps acknowledge that I have no idea what I'm doing - I could curl up in the cold beneath the silent statue's shadow, and see what surfaces in sleep.

I recall how in sleep I heard the changeling's carven churrings. I recall how in sleep I curled my fingers into the forms I found. I recall how in sleep I scratched the signs of secrets spoken to my other self. Here I hold them in my hands.
# Speculation
"Curled my fingers into the forms I found" remind me of [[Sabazine]]'s description, "curl our hands into the correct shapes"
