# Summary
> An extremely heterodox account of [[Jesus Christ|the Nazarene Messiah]] and his works, describing his ascension to the Mansus through the opening of his body.
# Reading
> Seven were the [[wounds]] of His body, seven the doors of the House. Seven the lesser aspects of the Hours, and [[Knock]] the aspect above all, for [[the Mother of Ants]] is the Mother of Salvation.'
# Read
> The book includes a description of a rite which can be used to raise a corpse to half-life, 'in memory of He who bled for the Wood'; but the marginalia claim that the Mother of Ants no longer permits use of this rite.

# Speculations

Who is [[he who bled for the Wood]]?
