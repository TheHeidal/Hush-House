# Untranslated
> Marked with the tripled sign of the arcane-contemplative order known as the Sisterhood of the Knot... but a fourth leaf has been added, disfiguring the sign. In Greek.
# Summary
> The heretical teachings of a disgraced offshoot of [[the Sisterhood of the Knot]], that arcane-contemplative order that existed in all histories. This was recorded by '[[Waznei]]', and dedicated to [[St Respicius]].
# Reading
> The offshoot favoured by Waznei - 'the True Sisterhood' - followed St Respicius in pursuing ascension in the name of [[the Watchman|the Door-in-the-Eye]], the merciless Hour of light. St Respicius failed, perhaps because the larger Sisterhood tracked him down and ritually strangled him, but Waznei outlines steps for those who hope to succeed.
# Read
> Seek in dreams; seek the Mansus. [[The Marks|The Third Mark]] can be achieved only when one has passed [[the Stag Door]]. One must pass [[the Wood]]. One must rise to [[the White Door]]. The Stag Door awaits the light-bearer, in the sight of [[Ghirbi]].
