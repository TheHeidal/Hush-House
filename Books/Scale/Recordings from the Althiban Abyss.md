# Summary
Recordings from a subterranean space in the mountains near [[Baghdad]] of 'conversations' between the entomologist [[Juliana Zawistowski]] and [[an unidentified presence]].
# Reading
Only Zawistoski's part in the 'conversations' is comprehensible to the listener. The other side consists of grating, buzzing and rumbling sounds, perhaps only rock movements or artifacts of the recording process, which Zawistoski nevertheless unhesitatingly translates.
# Read
Zawistoski seems to believe that the presence identifies itself as a Name or remnant of the lost Hour called [[the Seven-Coils|Seven-Coils]]. It pleads with her to assist its rebirth; it begs her to find something for it in the city of [[Emesa]]. Towards the end of the interview, Zawistoski grows suspicious, and repeatedly accuses the presence of being not the Seven-Coils at all - only 'an inhabitant.' The recording ends in mid-sentence.
# Speculation
An Inhabitant suggests it's maybe a being puppeted by [[Worms]] like in [[The Affair of the Endless Guest]]?
The [[Althiban Abyss]] is a Vault in Exile
