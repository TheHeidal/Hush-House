# Summary
> On the death of the Hour called [[the Seven-Coils|Seven-Coils]], 'the Father of the Mother'.
# Reading
> The first part of the poem describes the ambush of the Seven-Coils by a warrior 'scarred all over by the traitor gods, scarred even unto his eyes, so that the sight of the great coils would not destroy him'.
# Read
> The battle rages on until the Seven-Coils drowns in its own blood, at which point the narrative turns mystical and allusive. A seven-titled goddess arises from the foam of its blood: she is an armoured queen, a serpent-daughter, a key, a healer, a murderess, an oracle, but her seventh title is not to be revealed.
# Speculation
The scarred warrior is obviously [[The Colonel]], the seven-titled goddess is probably [[the Mother of Ants]]? Alternatively, it could be the ligeian [[Medusa]].
