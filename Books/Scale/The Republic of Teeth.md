# Summary
> An eccentric political tract by [[Valentine Dewulf]].
# Reading
> Valentine suggests that rulers should be elected to govern by [[snakes|serpents]], not their subjects, 'for the Serpent, being cold-blooded in its Nature, is incorruptible.'
# Read
> Valentine's initial proposal is that a college of electors should subject themselves to the bites of venomous serpents - which he grades and details, preferring the least dangerous - and should allow the resulting deliria to guide them in their choice of people's representatives. He becomes concerned, however, by the practicalities of ensuring equal quantities of venom in each case, and gets half-way into a proposal for using birds instead in the selection process, before giving up mid-sentence.
