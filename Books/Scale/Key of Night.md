# Summary
>The deliberations leading to a manifesto of the '[[Worms of a Scale]]', as recorded around 1900 in the Bar Vienna, in the cellar of the [[Hotel Ciervo]] in [[Port Noon]].
# Reading
> The Worms, all of whom use grandiose _noms de guerre_ like Citizen Knife and the Midnight Pilgrim, agree that all previous iterations of their movement have been feckless and treacherous, and agree that the return of the prehuman Hours - the [[gods-from-stone]] - is the true way to end 'the tyranny of [[Eternity]].'
# Read
>The Worms identify [[the Wheel]], [[the Tide]], [[the Flint]], [[Sulochana Amavasya|Sulochana]], [[the Spider's Door|the Spider Door]], [[the Excellency Gnathobasis|the Excellency Gnathobasis]] and [[Wickel Inextinguishable|Wickel Inextinguishable]] as the Seven Necessary Pentiments that must be 'returned to every History through the Propaganda of the Deed'. This is an eccentric list and clearly a compromise; the process of thrashing it out clearly exhausts all the participants, who don't specify the necessary Deed beyond a vague reference to 'the Loopholes'.
# Notes
Moving between histories is, I believe, a power of the [[Great Hooded Princes]].
Pentiments reminds me of [[Pentiments & Precursors]].
'the Loopholes' is likely a reference to [[Numen - Loopholes]].
