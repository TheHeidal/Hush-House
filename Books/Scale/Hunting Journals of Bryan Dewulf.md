# Summary
> [[Bryan Dewulf]], the son of [[Walter Dewulf|the 3rd Baron Brancrug]], gives advice on hunting in the Bounds.
# Reading
> It is clear from Bryan's journals that he sought unorthodox trophies and put them to unorthodox uses. He was in fact hanged as a witch at the age of twenty-four, and never inherited the estateâ€¦
# Read
> Bryan describes how a '[[Marazine Fife|Sky-inspired fife]]' can be prepared using these Fur and Feathers techniques, in the presence of greater Sky-aspect, to 'make of the winds good neighbours.' It's a powerful technique to be described so casually: Bryan's main interest seems to be in ensuring good weather for his hunts.
# Notes
> Contains a crafting hint for [[Wind-In-Waiting]]
