# Summary
>The order of [[House of Lethe|Obliviates]], on the brink of schism, assembles in a Bounds-house identified only as '[[Carbonek]]', after the Fisher-King's castle of legend. There the Know and the Long of the order debate their long policy of non-involvement in 'matters of Feather and Scale'.
# Reading
> One of their number - the one recording their debates - describes how in desperation he has found some kind of solution in a '[[The Sun Disfigured|volume of transcendent heresy]]', but dares not pursue it alone. He convinces a handful of other Obliviates to depart Carbonek with him, while the others cross the sea to [[Port Noon]].
# Readc
> In the last few pages, the author reveals himself as the Know-adept [[Ambrose Westcott]], writing in an uncharacteristically serious mode. He informs any who should find this work that he has returned the book he spoke of to '[[Chancel of the Abbey Church#Shrine The Chancel|Abbot Geffrey's Secret]]', where it can be retrieved with certain invocations of the Sacra Limiae. He hopes that one who has read this far, and understood this much, will find a History to determine.
