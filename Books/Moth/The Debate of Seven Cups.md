# Summary
> 'Distillations of Spirit' recorded by an alchemist who identifies himself in the foreword as 'But [[Sir Thomas Browne]]'s Reflexion.'
# Reading
>'Time is a pure Flame, and we live by an invisible Sun within us.' 
# Read
>'Darkness and Light divide the Course of Time, and until that Course is Run, Eternity remains History's Bed-Fellow. Sorrow then is Sense's final Solvent, and even a Tear, should it fall enow, might destroy a Stoneâ€¦'
# Speculation
I guess it talks about [[History and Eternity]]
