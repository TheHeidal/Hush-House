# Summary
A lusciously illustrated tome of loosely connected children's stories. Few of them are remotely suitable for children.
# Reading
The protagonist, a speechless [[cat]]-thing called [[Kitling Ripe]], performs a series of elaborate rites to rescue members of her extended famly, culminating in the resurrection of her 'other grandmother', [[the velvet|Moldywarp]]
# Read
When [[Medusa|the Snake-Witch]] killed the horse, Kitling snatched one of its eyes. When [[the Dry-Witch]] killed the pig, Kitling stole a cup of its blood. Then she took them to the place Moldywarp lay buried, and she shook out her hair, and she began to [[dance]]â€¦'

# Speculation
Possibly [[the Snake-Witch]] is [[Medusa]]? If so, the dry-witch is probably another Ligeian.
If Moldywarp is the velvet, then the velvet is a god-from-blood, born of sacrifice.
There's apparently connections to the [[Moth Victory]] from cultist simulator.
