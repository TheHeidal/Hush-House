# Summary
> In which four enigmatic figures tell the stories they've heard over the years at [[the Roost]], the secret location where the aviform Hours congregate.
# Reading
> INAAM: Has not [[the Beach-Crow]] shared his treasures? GARKIE: Not the rarest. He takes those things most precious, which he claims found, not stolen.
# Read
> The Beach-Crow, Kapigiginlupir suggests, is not only a thief, but also a spy and even a voyeur. He has hidden the memory of secret couplings among the Hours and their Names in the corners of the House, as treasures to gloat over. There is particularly fevered speculation on a liaison between [[the Malachite|the Ring-Yew]], that fervent hour of the Wood, and [[the Mare-in-the-Tree]], who sometimes has been the Witch's Sister.
# Notes

# Speculations
[[Inaam]], [[Kapigiginlupir]], [[Garkie]], and [[Cryppys]] are presumably the four enigmatic figures.
