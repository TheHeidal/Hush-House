# Summary
> Athena Vana's work on the rogue Hour called [[the Vagabond]], who is also known as the Laughingthrush, the Centipede, the Pilgrim, and by many other names - or as Vana has it, 'masks'.
# Reading
> The Mask of the Laughingthrush, says Athena Vana, had a great friendship with [[the Sun-in-Splendour]], the highmost Hour of the Mansus (now divided and departed). The Mask of the Sight-Thief painted [[the Painted River|the river in the Mansus]]. The Mask of the Vagabond was forbidden the Mansus, not for what she had done, but for what would occur...
# Read
> The Mask of the Centipede recalled her birth-place, [[Miah]], which had punished her for creeping into the temple precinct. This Mask cursed Miah to drink only dust and to be remembered only by the wind - 'for not beneath any Mask does she forgive, and the Centipede's hunger is not to be forgotten.'
