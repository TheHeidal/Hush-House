# Summary
> A very heterodox history of [[House of Lethe|the House of Lethe]] as recorded by '[[the Serenity]]' - a Lethean adept who declares that the House of Lethe was created explicitly to prevent the ascension of any more mortals to Name or Hour status.
# Reading
> 'Eternity cannot be escaped; but in History, it may be delayed,' the Serenity explains. 'The gods-who-were-flesh, by their nature, are a surrender to Eternity.'
# Read
> The 'roots of the House' are said to pass into the Wood of dreams through three forests in [[the Bounds]], identified as [[the Bei Ilai]], [[the Black Cedar Forest]], and [[the Broceliande|the Brecheliant]]. 'While one tree of these may yet stand, one single tree, the Histories continue.'
