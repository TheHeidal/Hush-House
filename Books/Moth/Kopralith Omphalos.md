# Summary
What is this? A tufted fossil of silken fibre, big as a child. \[This object houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
# Reading
Something consumed, and something was consumed. If we interpret its interweavings, we might understand.
# Read
The meaning of this object isn't something that one reads, but rather something that one follows, until at last one has passed three times around it, and one finds the meaning waiting at one's shoulder.
