# Summary
> [[Gideon Dewulf]], 5th Baron Brancrug, discusses techniques shared between medical suturing, tailoring, and - carefully, allusively - the binding of restless spirits.
# Reading
> Gideon's favourite motif is 'the history of the flesh'. He insists obscurely that histories should be woven, not written.
# Read
> Gideon speaks reverently of the '[[wyrd-weft]]', which he has achieved by applying [[Stitching & Binding|Stitching and Binding]] arts to a fabric in the presence of sufficient Heart. He laments however that its complexities only approach those understood by the Sisterhood of the Knot, which in turn are only a shadow of 'the true Braid of Histories'.
