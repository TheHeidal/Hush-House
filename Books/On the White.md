# Summary
> [[Solomon Husher]] writes, perhaps allegorically, of [[Winter]], and its long slow doomed romance with the Sun. The epigraph is '[[sunset]] at Noon'.
# Reading
> On closer investigation, the work seems to be a theory of aesthetics, or perhaps a set of warnings about the dangers of painting.
# Read
> Husher writes distractedly about his suspicion of colours and his yearning for death. He hints at a Great Work he has envisaged, or begun, where the '[[the Palest Painting|palest of paintings]]' will enthral the world. He returns again and again to certain compelling phrases which he claims are the 'secret words of Winter'.
