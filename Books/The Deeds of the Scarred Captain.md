# Summary
>Painstakingly assembled by the soldier of fortune and sometime remittance man, [[Pavel Shulga]], during his years in [[Greece]].
# Reading
> An account of the founding of [[Mycenae]] by a '[[The Colonel|Scarred Captain]]' who first slew [[the Seven-Coils|seven monsters]] to make the land safe.
# Read
> As the Captain destroys each monster, a flood of blood rises higher, until at last a priestess drowns and is reborn as [[the Mother of Ants|a serpent-goddess]]. She blesses the Captain, and he departs for the 'House above the Forest', leaving Mycenae to reign supreme after the flood of blood subsides.

# Speculations
This suggests that the Colonel might be a [[gods-from-blood|god-from-blood]].
