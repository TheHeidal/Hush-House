# Summary
>A fanciful account by [[Thirza Blake]] of the early life of [[the Twins]] - their time as mortals before they became Hours or even Long, in a 'dry kingdom beyond the Western Sea' which Thirza suggests might have been ancient [[Mexico]].
# Reading
>It is widely known that [[the Sister]] was rich and [[the Witch]] poor. It is widely known that the Witch loved the Sister first. It is not widely known that the Witch was first employed to teach the Sister the arts of embroideryâ€¦'
# Read
>Although Thirza is very probably just making up much of the story, there are long passages expounding notable techniques of weave-work and thread-feit. In particular, when Witch and Sister flee across the Sea to be together, Thirza explains how they fashioned a '[[Frith-Weft|peace-weave]]' with Heart and these arts, and then, to tame the winds, called on Heart again to [[Swaddled Thunder|swaddle the thunder]] in the peace-weave.
