# Summary
> A disgraceful compendium of ribald poetry about the habits and corruptions of [[Henry VIII]].
# Reading
> Henry's 'Great Misfortune' - his crushing injury at a jousting bout - has left him unable to stand 'any straighter than a splintered withy'â€¦
# Read
> The most savage mockery is reserved for Henry's '[[Great Debasement]]', where the corruption of his softer metal is supposed to have crept into the coin of the realm. The last and most serious lampoon makes seditious references to '[[the Crucible Revolution]]'.
