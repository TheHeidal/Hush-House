# Summary
[[The Barrowchild]], a Gaulish adept who won a place in the ranks of [[House of Lethe|the Ordo Limiae]], enumerates the '[[great shadows]]' laid to rest in tombs of power, and discusses their various conditions.
# Reading
The Barrowchild identifies numerous modes that are neither true death nor true life: the '[[vitrification of the heart]]'; '[[the corrupt light of the Wood]]'; '[[chor]]-stasis'; 'the wandering of the [[fet]]'â€¦
# Read
The Barrowchild warns particularly of the 'avidity of [[trist]]', where a remnant-shadow's longing for change survives its sense of self and even devours its [[wist]]. That longing may draw the curious into the tomb, where the remnant-shadow changes so that it cannot be distinguished from its visitor - or that the reverse becomes true - and that it is never again possible to say whether it is the shadow or the visitor that exits the tomb.
