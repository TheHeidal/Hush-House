# Summary
A more recent version of a much older text, this book describes the operations of  [[the Chancel]] and [[Calyptra|the Calyptra]], two triads of Hours with subtle, far-reaching powers and responsibilities. It has been heavily censored, but even so contains potent secrets.
# Read
'The deepest knowledge is safeguarded by the Covenant of the Watchman's Tree, whose patrons are [[Calyptra]] - the three flowers on [[the Watchman's Tree]] - blood, soot, and snowâ€¦'
# Reading
Calyptra may be known, as [[Night]], [[Dawn]], [[Eclipse]]. [[The Chancel]] may be known, as [[the Horned-Axe|Threshold]], [[Mirror]], [[Shell]]. Calyptra and Chancel then are two: is [[Janus]] a third?'
# Speculations
Holy shit, is Janus another triad of hours?
