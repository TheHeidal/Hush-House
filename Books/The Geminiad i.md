# Summary
> A fragile manuscript, illuminated with twinned shapes of sad and luminous beauty, and with all the phases of the [[moon]]. It might be as old as the seventh century, but the language - [[Fucine]] - is much older. The cover is tooled goatskin decorated with [[garnet]].
# Reading
>These pages outline the nature, and the doctrines, of an Hour that weaves together the willing, an Hour that is sought beneath the moon and at the water's edge: [[The Twins|the Sister-and-Witch]]. The language is wilful, knotty, poetic. It'll take some untangling.
# Read
>The first volume of the Geminiad reminds us that the Sister-and-Witch has been known to manifest as the Witch-and-Sister - and that this face is always hungry, while the other face may heal. It implies connections between the Sister-and-Witch and the Hours of the upper Mansus - especially the lunar Hour called the Meniscate - but it is ambiguous on whether the Sister-and-Witch is a Mansus-Hour proper. And it speaks at length about the sadness of the two-who-are-one, the sadness that remains from their time as flesh.
