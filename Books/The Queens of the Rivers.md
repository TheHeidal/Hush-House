# Summary
A surreal contemporary play by the enigmatic [[Monica Medina]], in which [[the Queens of the Rivers]] are murdered, one by one.
# Reading
The Queen of [[the Vistula]] is poisoned. The Queen of [[the Dnieper]] chokes on a fish-hook. The Queen of [[the Tagus]] is burnt alive...
# Read
The culprit, it transpires, is the audience. The surviving Queens are directed to execute whatever audience members do not escape. A surprisingly lucid epilogue suggests that the correspondence of river-names with historical events does provide clues to [[secret histories]] behind our own.
