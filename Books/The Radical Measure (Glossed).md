# Summary
The original '[[The Radical Measure|Radical Measures]]' was a manifesto for experimental poetry with occult properties, written in the nineteenth century by [[Dr Arun Peel]]. The original is notoriously incoherent - much later, [[Christopher Illopoly]] took on the task of editing and glossing it. He has taken some liberties, but the updated version is generally well regarded.
