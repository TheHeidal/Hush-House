Numa can be summoned with [[Porphyrine]] and 20 of any of [[Rose]], [[Moon]], or [[Knock]]. 

# Summoning Numa
## Rose
> Compose a Petition to the Vagabond
> With the proper arts and signs - and the proper *[[encaustum terminale]]* - a Librarian of the House might find a way to attract the direct attention of an Hour. [[the Vagabond]] has no dominion over Numa - no Hour does - but she knows it better than most. Perhaps the season will follow her here.
