The Keys of Dream are keys that open doors into [[the Mansus]], held by [[the Ligeian Club]].

It has been law since the rule of the [[gods-from-stone]] that the Keys cannot be held[^6][^7]. However, as [[alukite|alukites]] already exist outside the law, they can hold and own the Keys (but apparently not keep them).
# The Mare's Key
[[Rowena]] holds a key made of [[scolecite]], which opens the doors to [[Nowhere]].[^1] She has apparently once lent it to [[Ys]].
The mare's key might be related to [[the Mare-in-the-Tree]], especially given that she is a nowhere-hour.
# The Key of Black Sapphire:
[[Morgen]] holds the key of [[black sapphire]][^8].
I vaguely remember something about it actually being two keys?
# The Palest Key
[[Medusa]] holds the Palest Key[^5]
# The Hissing Key
[[Echidna]] holds the Hissing Key, which opens [[the Savage Door]][^2].
# The Flaying Key
[[Marinette]] holds the Flaying Key[^9], which she took from another.
# The Key of Days
[[Kleidouchos]] holds the Key of Days[^10].
