|Introduction| '…the King, or the Bell, or the City. Without History, none of them…'|
|Challenge| '…[[Ys]], the exception, but no exception to [[History and Eternity\|Eternity]] can last forever. That's rather the point! Only when I accepted that…'  |

Coseley seems to reference the conclusion he reached in [[Towards a Fundamental Aesthetic - Second Edition]].
