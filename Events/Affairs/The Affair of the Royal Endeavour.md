> [[Henry Huddleston Abney-Hastings|The New King]] has sanctioned the use of the Crown's wealth to fund a visionary new industrial project - one that will transform our economy, and furnish the kingdom with a sense of patriotic mission. Parliament, dazzled, has already passed the Royal Endeavour Act, mandating the construction of the necessary facilities, although the details remain in some respects vague.
