|Introduction| 'There will be a production in Paris of an opera that celebrates the Grail. I have decided to offer suitable gifts to the performers.'  |
|Given A Book | 'Delicious. I can be certain now of a generous and memorable feast. You might yet prove more useful than your predecessors.'  |
| Acted | After visiting Hush House, Magister Hokobald believed he had determined the most suitable gifts for the performers. He almost thanked me for it. |

|--|--|
|Introduction| On 'Apollo and Marsyas'<br><br>'No, I'm not going to the performance. It's not bad, I spose, I mean you can hum the overture, but it's not exactly Mozart, if you know what I mean? No, I'm on a mission.' |
|Given A Book | 'Thanks, Librarian. I'll what to look for now. Keep this between us, will you? I hope I can just buy the book, but its owner's reputation is, eh, he's not always co-operative, you know?'  |

| Person | [[MCO Constance Lee]] |
| ---- | ---- |
| Given Card | 'This opera in Paris. I smell trouble.' |
| Problem | 'I'm worried about the audience, I'm worried about the backers, I'm very worried about the tenor, and I'm very very worried about the caterers. I know, I'm a worrier. But I don't understand enough about the work and its consequences. Help me out?' |
| Given A Book | ' I'll talk to our cousins of [[the Duties]] in Paris. Perhaps it's not as bad as I'd thought…'  |
| Acted | MCO Lee was reassured that the opera might present a lesser oneiric hazard than she had feared... but resolved still to talk to 'our cousins of the Duties' in Paris. |

| Given Card   | ''Apollo and Marsyas'. The score had been thought lost… and I am pleased to say I played my small part in its recovery. It is rather old. I have been asked to help arrange it to suit, ah, contemporary expectations.' |
| Given A Book | TKTK                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Person | [[Morgen\|Mlle Matutine]] |
| ---- | ---- |
| Given Event Card | 'I wish to attend the première of an opera - one I have always very much enjoyed…' |
| Needing A Book | 'Persons of some interest to me will attend also. It is important that I be seen at my best. I am looking for a very particular inspiration…' |
| Given A Book (Grail) | 'Choice, and rare! Oh ho ho, I had hoped for this exactly. Thank you, my Librarian.'  |
| Given A Book (Sky) | 'This is not what I had expected, but if it had, it would not be inspiration, no? Thank you, my Librarian.'  |
| Acted | Mlle Matutine was confident she would be the best-dressed woman in the audience. |

| Person | [[Princess Coquille Amirejibi]] |
| ---- | ---- |
| Introduction | 'Apollo and Marsyas. Horrid story. Always puts me in mind of the most <i>aggravating</i> uncle…' |
| Needing A Bo | 'It's <i>certain</i> to be quite the most <i>crushing</i> bore, but if I <i>happen</i> to go, I have some rather <i>vivid</i> ideas for my look. I just need to, you know, flesh them out.' |
| Given A Book | 'Smudgy little line between ghastly and thrilling, darling, isn't there? But I rather think this is on the right side of the line.' |
| Acted | Princess Coquille was confident she would be the best-dressed woman in the audience. 

| Person | [[Ehsan Fekri]] |
| ---- | ---- |
| Given Card | ''Apollo and Marsyas' is to be performed again in Paris. It is a great work, Librarian… in more than one sense.'  |
| Needing A Book | ''Law's touch is lighter than we know'. When we invoke the Thunderskin, there can be unexpected consequences in the kingdoms of the lower skies…' |
| Given A Book | 'I am reassured. Perhaps, after all, no storm will stir; perhaps everyone will just have a good night out. It surely must happen sooner or later. '  |
| Acted | What Ehsan learnt at Hush House convinced him that the production would not trouble the lower skies - especially, perhaps, with his intercession. |
