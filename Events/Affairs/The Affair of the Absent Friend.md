> The Ligeian [[Medusa]] is long dead, as is well attested. It's nevertheless well-attested also that she walks the streets of [[Budapest]] by moonlight. That's just one of those things. But now, for the first time, she's being glimpsed in daylight too. What could <i>that</i> portend?

| [[Dr Ibn al-Adim]]   | ''She is the oldest of her kind still living; and she is dead.' That is how we are accustomed to speak of the Ligeian Medusa, who haunts the nights in Budapest… but now it seems she has begun to haunt the days.' | 'Medusa's riddle is 'What Is Not Seen?'  There is rarely only one answer to a Ligeian riddle. If I am to go to Budapest, I would go prepared.'                                                                                                          | 'Some authorities favour 'Eternity'. Others 'the Cross', but I fear that might irritate her… perhaps it would be safest to resolve that the answer is 'Me'. Thank you, Librarian.' | The Aleppine could not determine the best answer for Medusa's Riddle, 'What Is Not Seen?' He suggested wryly that the answer should be he himself. |
| [[Ms Azita Bukhara]] | 'My dearest enemy - [[Mehrad]] - has invited me to a challenge in Budapest…'                                                                                                                                        | 'Mehrad tells me that Medusa has begun to walk more openly in Budapest. We will both seek her out. The first to cut a scrap from her robe will win the challenge. There may be a tussle, of course. I can handle Mehrad, but Medusa is another matter.' | 'Most helpful, Librarian. Thank you for indulging our silly games.'                                                                                                                | Azita set off to play her 'silly games' with her enemy-twin Mehrad in Budapest... competing to cut a scrap from the robe of Medusa herself.        |
