From the far monastery of [[Saint Tentreto|St Tentreto]] in [[the Evening Isles]], we hear uncertain and contradictory stories, of unexpected visitors - visitors from behind the sky.

| |[[Dr Ibn al-Adim]]|
|--|--|
|Introduction| 'What is happening in the West, I wonder? If it is something old, I might desire to witness it. If it is something new, I might desire to chronicle it. If it is both… then I should make plans to travel there immediately.'|
|Challenge|'We approach the season of changes. I have grown long in history, but I remain narrow, cartographically speaking. To cross the ocean will take me far from other matters of interest. I will not go West to witness this thing unless I am certain it is worthy of my attention...'|
|Scale|'Whenever the skies coincide, the travelling kinds of [[the Carapace Cross]] visit their old home. They are wary - they never stay long. It happens rarely, but it has happened before. Each time, our more excitable peers resolve that they have returned to stay, that everything will change, that the Cross within will manifest. It never does. But I do not take it for granted that it never will. I think it will be necessary for me to cross the ocean...' |

| Person | [[Fraser Strathcoyne]] |
|--|--|
|Introduction|'You know of course that [[Saint Tentreto\|Saint Tentreto]] was never recognised by the Church. But the traditions go back, to the Romans and before, in the isles and along the coasts of every ocean…'|
|Challenge| 'The shapes reported in the clouds of the West - I've heard of them - or I've seen them in my dreams - or both. I must be certain where my dreams end and where history begins.'|
| Scale | 'We have waited so long, Librarian. So long that no memory goes all the way back; not even the memories beneath the skin.' |
|Resolution| Fraser Strathcoyne was eager to travel West and embrace his latent second nature.|

| Person | [[MCO Constance Lee]] |
|--|--|
|Introduction| 'There are cases all up and down the western coasts, of Britain, Ireland, France… people swimming out to sea. We don't even know if they drowned. We haven't found any bodies.'
|Resolution| 'I understand where they're going, even if I don't know why. I'd like to make a field trip… but I''m not certain I want to travel by aeroplane, not while this is going on. You know, if I were you, I wouldn't take any beach walks at sunset, not until all this settles down. Just in case.'  |
| Sky | MCO Lee, concerned by the call of the West, decided not to go there in person - instead resolving that the Bureau should do what it could to keep the coasts safe.|

| Person |[[Mr Peter Agdistis]] |
|--|--|
|Introduction|'The clouds have been called 'the dancers of the lower skies'. At sunset, I am their audience. I know their moods and modes, very well. But lately there has been a change. The dancers of the lower skies have become first coquettish - now insistent.'
|Challenge| 'I am summoned West. I understand where I am being asked to go. I do not understand why.' |
| Resolution | 'Change, Librarian. We who dedicate ourselves to [[Marsyas]], to the dance that does not end - we have a contradictory relationship with change. If I go West, I am promised that I will become something more… but I will not; I am happy with what I am; almost happy.' |
| Sky | Mr Agdistis decided to ignore the summoning to go West, electing to reject the possibility of transformation, and remain what he was.|

| Person | [[Ms Azita Bukhara]] |
|--|--|
|Introduction| 'My dearest enemy - [[Mehrdad\|Mehrad]] - has gone West to the Evening Isles. Before I follow him, I must know why.' |
|Fail|'Mehrad sent me the Taunt that protocol requires - he is always courteous - nothing unusual in that - but he describes a shape he saw in the clouds. It troubles me.'|
|Resolution| '[[the Carapace Cross|The Cross]], is it? After all these years, I find something else that Mehrad and I do not have in common. It is almost romantic! And all thanks to you, Librarian.'  |
|Sky| The Edge-long Azita came to believe that her enemy-twin Mehrad was one of those in whom the Cross-nature endured; and she followed him West.|


| Person | [[Morgen]] |
|--|--|
|Introduction| 'Something in the clouds above the Evening Isles, they say...' |
|Challenge| 'I have sisters in the clouds above the Evening Isles. I think the monks of St Tentreto would know to avoid their attentions. And so I think there must be something else up there - something new, or old. I should inform myself before I travel to the Isles...' |
|Response | 'I begin to form a conception… we will see. And perhaps, my Librarian, you should observe also the clouds above Brancrug.'|
|Acted, Sky|Mlle Matutine, armed with knowledge, travelled West to see the business for herself; and warned that something might also come to the clouds above Brancrug.|

WHAT ARE THE SISTERS. Other Ligeians?

| Person | [[Ehsan Fekri]] |
|--|--|
|Introduction| 'I have been asked to help the sufferers of a novel mania. They see shapes in the clouds - shapes that frighten and delight them. They wish to travel into the West. They insist. They grow violent…' |
|Challenge| 'There is something within them that opens their eyes to the allure of the lower skies - something that seeks to change them. I must know how to quell it.' |
| Response | 'I understand now how I might close their eyes to the skies. Not every appetite should be fed, Librarian. They will be very grateful when the mania has passed. And their families will be grateful now. We cannot be two things at once… no, I am not easy with this. But I choose the lesser harm. Thank you for your help.'|
|Acted, Sky| Ehsan set out to help patients who had heard the call of the clouds -  by suppressing their mania to travel West - though not without some qualms.|
