  
Like many criminal enterprises, [[Reckoners]] offer loans to the desperate and unwary - but Reckoners can offer loans not only of cash, but of [[Trade in Years|allotted years of life]]. They usually keep a low profile, but now two Reckoner mobs have gone to war in the unremarkable Lithuanian city of [[Kaunas]]. Why? What's in Kaunas?

| Introduction | [[Reckoners]]. They are not stupid. But enough of them - enough of them are <i>very</i> stupid.'                                                                                                                                  |
| Challenge    | One of the Reckoner lords now in [[Kaunas]] fancies himself an adept. So of course he has botched a conjuring, and of course now the conjuring has made its nest in the sewers. Always, these things take to the sewers. Always.' |
| TKTK         | I have what I need. (Except that I will also need a bath.) Thank you.'                                                                                                                                                            |
|              | Lalla Chaima set off, without enthusiasm, to complete a commission for a Reckoner lord in the sewers of Kaunas.                                                                                                                   |

|Introduction| [[Suppression Bureau\|The Bureau]] has no business that far from home. But the local [[the Duties|Duties]] have asked for our help.' |
|Challenge| I have a theory about how this quarrel beganâ€¦ I'd like to look into it, Librarian.'  |
| TKTK | Librarian... this [[the trade of years\|trade of years]]. It's [[the Madrugad]] who keeps the tally, and the Madrugad who is invoked when [[Reckoners]] make the trade. I think, just possibly, the stupidest Reckoner in the history of stupidity has turned a profit by cheating the Madrugad. I don't know who's going to regret that most. I'd better get to [[Kaunas]].'|
||MCO Lee, greatly concerned that a Reckoner might somehow have found a way to cheat the Madrugad, left for Kaunas in a hurry.|
