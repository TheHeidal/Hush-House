> In the hissing wastes of sand where once stood a city called [[Miah]]… another man has died. But he almost made it out. He made it far enough that a goatherd found him, raving to the end about gardens, with a flower crushed in his hand.

Moth and Rose

| [[Lalla Chaima]]      | 'Miah, in the desert. Always they come to me for the desert work.'                                                                                                                                             | 'Deserts… they are not all so alike as the Bureau thinks. Deserts with hauntings and with curses, even less alike.'                                                                                                                                                                   | 'I think that this will be enough. I leave now for Miah. Thank you.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Lalla Chaima undertook a commission for the Bureau in Miah - whether to find the piebald garden, or conceal it, was never clear.                                         |
| [[Dr Arun Peel]]      | 'I wonder how many of us tell you the truth? I wonder if any of us do? I wonder if you are ever tempted to stuff <i>our</i> eyes with nonsense? I am sorry. This is unhelpful of me. Let's talk about petals.' | 'Petals, a friend used to say, are the skin of flowers; and flowers are the hair of a plant. I wonder what it means, this dappled rose? I'd like to look in your collection.'                                                                                                         | 'I think, Librarian, we may be approaching a turn in history when flowers seek moths, and not so much the other way around. I'm sorry. It's very hard for me not to speak in riddles. Let me try this. Be very careful when the time comes to stand beneath the tree. The choice is always yours.' | the Dr Peel, as so often, found what he sought at Brancrug, delivered himself of a riddle, and departed, his intentions still obscure.                                   |
| [[Dr Ibn al-Adim]]    | 'Yes, I am counted among the Long. 'Immortal' is too optimistic a word. All of us have our patrons. If we are lucky, we never draw their direct attention...'                                                  | 'I have been charged to find this piebald garden in the ruins of Miah, and to pluck there a piebald rose… as a keepsake, I am told. My patron has been generous, but she is not merciful. Still this 'keepsake' business worries me. I would like to study the matter a little more.' | 'Long ago, you know, there were not so many colours in the world… I suppose life was simpler then. But I prefer the luxury we have of hues. Thank you, Librarian.'                                                                                                                                 | At the behest of his patron [[the Vagabond]], the Aleppine set out to find the piebald garden in the wastes... but his heart was troubled within him.                    |
| [[Daymare]]           | 'Been to Miah, you know. What there's left of it. Wouldn't go back.'                                                                                                                                           | 'Not going back to Miah. Said that already. But that rose that poor feller died for. Black and white one, you see? Rings a bell, tickles a nerve, taps on the old brain-pan…'                                                                                                         | 'Dappled rose. Still don't know. But the Vagabond liked gardens, don't you know. And Moth. Might go back to Miah after all. I wonder…'                                                                                                                                                             | Something in the story of the Dappled Rose made 'Daymare' wonder if she should return to Miah, one more time...                                                          |
| [[Mme Olympe Bechet]] | 'This story from Miah - it interests me. I have an idea the House might help me follow up.'                                                                                                                    | 'There is a tale that the Vagabond planted a black and white garden in Miah, before the curse, where the Moth would come at night. There are always tales…'Interest.]                                                                                                                 | 'Thank you. I have enough to make a start. I really don't want to go all that way to Miah myself - it's not so very exceptional a story! - but I think I might know someone who can help. Again, thank you.'                                                                                       | Mme Bechet had no intention of going all the way to Miah... but after researching the matter at the House, she remembered an associate who might go there on her behalf. |
