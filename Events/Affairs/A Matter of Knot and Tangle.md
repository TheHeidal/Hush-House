| [[Rowena\|Professor Rewena Hengerst]] | 'Without [[the Red Grail]], I would never have come here. Without the Red Grail, I would have died happy. But I'd have died.'     | 'She's misunderstood, the Grail, more than any other Hour. Without her, the drift to Eternity would never have lasted this long… show me, something, Librarian, to make that drift a little longer.' | 'When I was here - the first time - the first sacrifice I made was to the Grail. Without that, there would be no Hush House at all. Oh, the covenant-stone, the tree, all that, perhaps. But remember that it all begins with birth.' |                                                                                                                                                            |
