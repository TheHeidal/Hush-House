The Wings in the Wood  
  
When the first hunters came to [[The Wood]], in the days before its darkening, they found a chrysalis of black and white. To it they sacrificed the [[birds]] of the air, so that it would show them the way home. So [[the Moth]] came to be, and so the Moth was the first to navigate the ways of the Wood. [Furs & Feathers]

The Well in the Wood

When the first hunters were starving in the Wood, in the days before its darkening, they found a deep and crimson well. In it they drowned the beasts of the earth, so that the beasts would be reborn threefold, and the hunters could feast. So [[the Red Grail]] came to be, and so ever since she feeds us and she feeds upon us. This, the Matriarchs of the Knot have taught us.

[[The Moth]] and [[the Red Grail]] are [[gods-from-blood]] and woods-hours
