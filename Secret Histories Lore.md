# Lore
## An Occult Scrap
> Secret histories are layered beneath the one we know, like the notes in rare wine. This is a detail from one of those histories. \[Exploring with this scrap of knowledge may uncover secret locations in [[the Capital]].]
## A Furtive Truth
> A detail smuggled in from an adjacent narrative. Don't speak this where you may be overheard. \[Exploring with this scrap of knowledge may uncover secret locations in [[the Shires]].]
## A Forgotten Chronicle
>A story of a city without a gate, of a queen who was not born, of a war which was not fought. \[Exploring with this scrap of knowledge may uncover secret locations on [[the Continent]].]
## Forbidden Epic
> The attention of the Hours is drawn to the bloodiest wars. Afterwards, the Histories are braided like hair. \[Exploring with this scrap of knowledge may uncover secret locations in [[the Land Beyond the Forest]], across the Continent.]
## Unresolved Ambiguity
> In the Mansus, the Hours strive one against another. As the struggles are resolved, they iron out the impossible, exalt the possible, tie the fraying braids of what has been into one golden ribbon of future. Everything is resolved. History becomes the past. There are, however, exceptions. \[Exploring with this scrap of knowledge may uncover secret locations in [[the Rending Mountains]], three thousand miles away among the wreck of the oldest empires.]
## Vagabond's Map
> [[the Vagabond]] is the one Hour who can never enter [the Mansus] but she goes everywhere else... and, if you believe her boasts, she's the only one who knows all the Histories. Sometimes, she lets someone record her travels. \[Exploring with this scrap of knowledge may uncover secret locations in [[the Lone and Level Sands]], far from here.]
## A Port Noon Anectdote
> [[Port Noon]] is where the Long go to enjoy the sea and the sun, to drink from [[the Spring|the Spring]] that makes them forgotten, and to stay out of trouble. Mostly out of trouble. The stories you can hear in [[the Hotel Ciervo]] are golden-dewed, quintuple-distilled toasts to memory, served straight up. \[Exploring with this scrap of knowledge may uncover secret locations in [[the Evening Isles]], where Port Noon is located, across the great ocean.]
