# Summary
The first volume of [[Teresa Galmier]]'s examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans.
# Reading

# Read
Time and again we hear of [[the Wood]], which rises from the world's foundation. All trees reach for light. What does the Wood reach for? Is there a difference between light and Light? I think the key to dreams of the Wood might be one of these - the one that isn't exactly real.'
