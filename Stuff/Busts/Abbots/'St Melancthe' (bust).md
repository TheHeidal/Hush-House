## Description:
> Visionary, philosopher, alchemist. Most revered, and most heterodox, of the isle's abbesses. An inscription in Latin reads: THE CROSS DIED NOT BUT PASSED WITHIN.
## Inspect
> On closer inspection, this is a reliquary bust; which is to say, if I cracked it open, I could retrieve [[Abbess Melancthe|St Melancthe]]'s actual skull. That would be uncouth.

Obvious reference to [[the Carapace Cross]].
