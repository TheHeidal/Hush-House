> A magnificent depiction in oils of an elegantly dressed eighteenth century couple. The face of the gentleman, however, was long ago obliterated by a splash of some dark, corrosive substance.

> In her youth, [[Eva Dewulf|Lady Eva]] is engaged to be married to an [[Abraham Wheelock]] of [[Monmouthshire]], but in 1725 he leaves her at the altar. Furious and humiliated, she returns to Brancrug, and is not seen in London again.  
> Three days after her departure, Abraham Wheelock's body is washed up near Gravesend. His face is so badly pecked by birds that he is only identified by his belongings. These include a waxed pouch containing a letter addressed to Wheelock, whose contents seem to show he is a spy in the pay of the Austrians. Subsequent investigations suggest that the letter is a forgery, but the matter remains obscure.
