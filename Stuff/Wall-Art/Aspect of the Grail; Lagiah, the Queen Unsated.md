A painting found in [[Our Lady Beneath (Room)]]

>  One of the crueller aspects of [[the Red Grail]]: [[Lagiah]], the Queen Unsated, devouring mother, sister-lover of [[Antaios]]. One tradition has it that Lagiah took animal form so that she could satisfy her craving to devour her own children, and go unpunished - another that the animal form was the punishment for her incest. [[The Red Grail||The Grail]] has often been tolerant of contradictions. Perhaps her part in [[the Intercalate]] really was, after all, a long and subtle move to undermine [[History and Eternity|Eternity]]. Or perhaps she's just not to be trusted.
