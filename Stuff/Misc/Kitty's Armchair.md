A plush blue armchair, found in [[the Watchman's Tower#Observatory|the observatory]]

This looks very like the armchair in which [[Kitty Mazarine]], second Librarian, sat for [[El Bret√≥n']]s famous group portrait.
Kitty Mazarine (the story goes) napped in an armchair and dreamt of mirrors. She woke to find herself humming an unknown melody. That melody became her fuging-tune '[[Thirty Birds]]'. If this is really that armchair, it's a little bit of history.
