[[Thirza Blake]] invited [[Thirza's Friend|a nameless friend]] (or according to Brancrug tradition, her sister) to Hush House to recover from an illness. Thirza was uncharacteristically secretive about the whole business, perhaps because her own solicitude embarrassed her. She cooked her guest's meals herself; read to her in the afternoons; and purchased this phonograph so her guest could listen to [[Viennese opera]].
