Desk: Reading Room

> The bookwheel is a Dewulf heirloom - a gift to [[Eva Dewulf]] from her admirer, the adept [[Franklin Bancroft]]. The desk and lectern are much more recent. Steel plaques on both read 'TO [[GERVINUS VAN LAUREN]] - IN GRATITUDE FOR HIS ASSISTANCE IN THE CLOSING OF [[Grand Ascent|THE WINDING STAIR]] - [[Edith Abney-Hastings|E. ABNEY-HASTINGS]], [[NOCTURNAL SECRETARY]], 1928'
