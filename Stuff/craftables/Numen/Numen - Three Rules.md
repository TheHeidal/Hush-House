> The Hours are bound by their own edicts - even [[the Chancel]] and [[Calyptra|the Calyptra]]. That's why their deepest rules are secret. In certain Histories, if we know those deepest rules, we know what even the Chancel and the Calyptra may not do.  *\[Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but [[the Revolutionary]] can win a particular victory.]*

## Revolutionary Victory: The First Defiance
> **The Gods-from-Stone Will Be Remembered**
> Calyptra's weakness will become manifest; and [[gods-from-stone|the Gods-who-were-Stone]] will be named beneath the sky. This will be the first defiance.
> 
> In the last days of the Gods-from-Stone, the seek of the Watchman's Tree was planted. The Calyptra will preserve the tree, but they cannot uproot a second sapling. I will plant it on the beach beneath the closed horizon; I will water it with salt blood and salted sacrament; and the memory of the Gods-from-Stone will flower on its wounded skin. In quiet times, it will be a shelter, and in other times, perhaps a gallows-tree.
## The Foundation of Riddles
> In the last days of the Gods-from-Stone, the seed of the Watchman's Tree was planted. The Calyptra will preserve the tree, but they cannot uproot a second sapling. I will plant it on the beach beneath the closed horizon; I will water it with salt blood and salted sacrament; and the memory of the Gods-from-Stone will flower on its wounded skin.

## Revolutionary Victory: A City Forever Unbuilt
> **The Revolution in the Heart**
> [[the City Unbuilt|Our revolution's city]] will rise only in mortal hearts, where [[Calyptra]] cannot touch it.
> We are citizens of a republic we'll never see. Our walls are paper and our rivers are only ink. But we are the children of History. Let Eternity tremble!

## Revolutionary Victory: Revolution in Red
> **The Second Dawn: An Old Sun, Red and Low**
> *In this History, the gentler sun will return - the sun of the time before Calyptra - and Calyptra will be powerless to prevent it.*
> The Watchman's Tree has a Black Flower, but [[the Egg Unhatching|the Red Sun]] cannot be forgotten. It has a White, but his light runs red on snow. It has a Red Flower, but in this History, when the Sanguine Exception is invoked, the Red Flower will close its petals. And the Red Sun will hatch, but gently. Each day it will accept a little - a very little - of our blood... and each night it will protect us. As it goes down into evening, as it rises in the morning, it will remember us in song.... a song that even the Calyptra cannot silence.
