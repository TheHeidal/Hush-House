> The Stag Door: a ridged barrier of blood-streaked horn, huge enough for a ship to pass. It was broken long ago, and even now the scars are not quite healed. In a declivity beside the door rests a vast and wounded golden Head. Its mouth would be large enough to swallow me, were its jaw not shattered. It is the Name, [[Ghirbi]]. It begins to intone its riddle.

A door into [[the Mansus]] which connects to [[the Painted River]] and [[the Ascent of Knives]].

> In sleep, I ran my fingers along the ridged edges of the Stag Door's scars. 'Our company it was that shattered it,' Ghirbi says suddenly. 'Before the [[gods-from-flesh|Gods-who-were-flesh]], the Mansus was forbidden to mortals. We were the first [[Know]].' He begins again to wipe his molten tears. 'I wish that we had not. I wish I had died in the world...'. I have forgotten what else he said. But I remember the shape of the fissures in the Stag Door, and for all of today, doors will fear my touch.
