> The rites of [[the Church of the Unconquered Sun]], and certain secrets of the [[Gods-from-Glory|gods-from-Light]].

> [!ILLUMINATION] A Light Within
> [[Henry Huddleston Abney-Hastings|The New King]]'s light is uncertain. The Received Version of the Book of Suns tells that the Sun-in-Splendour will never return. If the King claims otherwise, he leads us astray. We should seek answers in Illumination.

> [!Horomachistry] A Light Above
> [[Henry Huddleston Abney-Hastings|The New King]]'s light shines brightly. The Sanctioned Version of [[the Book of Suns]] tells us that he may herald the unification of the gods-who-were-Light, into a new Sun-in-Splendour.  We should seek answers in Horomachistry.
