> The seven tainted immortals we call Ligeians are relentless in their appetite, and outcast under the laws of heaven. But they have their uses to the Hours. The Ligeian [[Echidna]] learnt her shaping arts in the world's dawn, and even now the Lionsmith values her skill; so every year they meet in the desert, among the furnace shadows of [[the Seven-Coiled temple]], to share their knowledge of how monsters were made. We call their stories Skolekosophy.

The Ligeian [[Kleidouchos]] has known all the great keys, and even now she holds the Key of Days; so every year she meets [[the Vagabond]] in [[Vienna]], to exchange the names of lesser keys for the stories of the Vagabond's travels. We call their gossip [[Birdsong]].
