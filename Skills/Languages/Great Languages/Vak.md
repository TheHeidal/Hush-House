# Description
> Before gods arose from blood, before ever ape stood upright, this was the language heard in the House of the Sun.... 'I am Vak,' [[the Peacock Door]] boasted, 'both the tongue and the Goddess. I am the only entrance into secret light. I was worshipped before you upright apes, and I will be still when all of you are ugly ash. Listen, and I will prove it.

> An Arrangement
> Something not commonly understood: without Vak, the exception, there could be no Calyptra, the law. Vak is in this sense, and perhaps in every sense, Calyptra's servant. This is known to scholars of the Night Arts.

>An Opportunity
>Something not commonly understood: were there no Calyptra to conceal perilous knowledge, there could be no Vak. A door opens both ways. This is understood by scholars of the Arts Unregarded.
