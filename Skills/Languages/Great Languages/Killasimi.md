# Description

If there is speech in [[Nowhere]]; if there is a language used by the Dead; if [[the House of the Moon]] has a native tongue; then it must be Killasimi. If none of this is true, it is still not a language to be spoken in daylight. Each word breathes woe. Read it, as they say, and weep.

The Carpenter's Tale

There is a prophecy among [[carpenters]]: a master of their kind will resolve, unwisely, that the coffins he shapes are too beautiful to sully with corpses. He will steal trinkets from the dead, he will ask the help of smiths and jewellers, and day and night he will labour to shape something worthy of his work. At last he will tire of his task and offer his breath to the shape in the casket. When it accepts, it will rise from the coffin and pronounce itself King. It will rule by fear, or fear will destroy it. In either case, its maker will have no coffin and no grave, and his name will be lost.

The Weaver's Tale

There is a prophecy among weavers: of one who will unwisely seek to find the future in a tapestry of her own hair. Her house will grow dark, shrouded in the labyrinths of her tresses. Pilgrims will seek her in the cellar of her house, where she will plead with them to cut her free. They will always fail, and she will always devour them. At last one will come who will ask instead to stay with her. Others will join them, until the house becomes a palace and the palace a city, below the world, where all are welcome and in the tapestry all truths are revealed.
