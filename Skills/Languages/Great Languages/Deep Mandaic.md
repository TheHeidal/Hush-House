> [!Horomachistry] The Jeweller's Tale
> There is a story known to jewellers: of a guild-master who made a wager with a keeper of butterflies. The master-jeweller claimed his jewelled egg would hatch something greater than any of the butterfly-keeper's chrysalids. Of course, after a month, the butterfly-keeper's gardens were bright with wings and the egg had hatched nothing at all. The jeweller, unable to pay his debts, fled into the desert with his egg. Horomachistry teaches us: know your limits.

> [!Ithastry] The Chandler's Tale
> There is a story known to candle-makers: of a guild-master who made a wager with a master of the potter's guild. The potter's oldest cup (she said) was older far than the chandler's oldest candle. However often one drinks from a cup, it can always be refilled. So they brought their witnesses to the judging on the appointed day, and the potter's witness brought a cup he had used for seventy years until its shattering. But the chandler's witness brought a candle seventy-<i>seven</i> years old: every month, the chandler had bought the old stumps, returned their matter to the vat, and used them in his wares, so that each newest candle was also the oldest. Ithastry teaches us: there's always a way.
