Truths that Were  
  
The inks called [[encaustum terminale]] are permitted only to the Librarians of [[the Watchman's Tree]]. Those inks can be used to reveal truths - even truths that are no longer so, not since the dawn times when the sun hung red and low and we felt its warmth like autumn. If that first and gentlest sun returned, the truths might return with it. [Inks of Revelation]
