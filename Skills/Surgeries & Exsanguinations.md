> [!Hushery] The White
> [[The Watchman's Tree]] has flowers three: Black, Red, and White. Red is the life that flows in the body's courses, and white is the writing at the body's core. [[Hushery]] teaches what ends.

> [!Preservation] The Golden
> In the times when nothing was forgotten, three flowers bloomed on the Watchman's Tree: Black, Red, and Gold. Red is the life that flows in the body's courses, but the blood of the Carapace Cross was golden. [[Preservation]] teaches what endures.
