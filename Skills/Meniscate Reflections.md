What Might Be  
  
Dream of a [[the City Unbuilt|city]] of perfect balance. There can be no perfect balance outside dream. Meditate on the Hour named [[the Meniscate|Meniscate]], whose light distinguishes the possible from the real. Let the City remain unbuilt.

What Could Be

Dream of a city of perfect balance. There can be no perfect balance outside dream. Meditate on the Hour named Meniscate, whose light is cast in dreams but we see even in the Wake. Build the City in the heart of her domain, in [[the House of the Moon]]. Be Illuminated.
