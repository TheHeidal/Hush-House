# Description
> The oldest Hours are the [[gods-from-blood]], who rose from sacrifice. That blood was always spilt on the roots, and the rites of its spilling are still remembered.

> [!bosk] What is Taken  
> The oldest *living* hours are the [[gods-from-blood|gods-who-were-blood]]. The [[gods-from-Stone]] were older still, but they're buried in the [[earth]], scattered in the [[sea]], lost to the [[the moon (symbol)|moon]]. This is why we're always careful where we make the sacrifice, because if we spilt enough blood on their graves, they'd return for their revenge. Bosk knows.

> [!Preservation] What is Given 
> The oldest <i>living</i> hours are the [[gods-from-blood|gods-who-were-blood]]. The [[gods-from-Stone]] were older still, but they're buried in the earth, scattered in the sea, lost to the moon. This is why we're always careful where we make the sacrifice: without it, the gods-from-Stone would pass from memory. This is Preservation.

# Speculation

The [[gods-from-stone]] are gone, but sacrifice could bring them back.
