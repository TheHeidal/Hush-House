> The rites of [[House of Lethe|an order of immortals]] who have tried to remain apart. These rites touch on secrets of Hours of the Mansus - chiefly [[gods-from-flesh|gods-who-were-flesh]] and [[Gods-from-Glory|gods-from-Light]].

> [!Hushery] Of Endings
> The Hours are not eternal. [[The Sun-in-Splendour]] was riven and cast down. If we mortals so desire, we might prevent his return. Understand [[Hushery]], and you understand endings.

> [!Horomachistry]  Of Limits  
> The Hours are not all-powerful. There is a place beyond their reach, where mortals and immortals might build a [[the City Unbuilt|shining City]] of [[iron]] and [[ivory]]. [[Horomachistry|Horomachists]] understand the Hours' limits.

# Speculation

"a place beyond their reach" might refer to [[Port Noon]]
