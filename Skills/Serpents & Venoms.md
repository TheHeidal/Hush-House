> [!skolekosophy] The First Sun
> In the dawn times the sun was lower, so we gave it our blood. From our blood it knew us, and so it was kinder. But those days are long gone. If we were foolish enough to find the first Sun and give it our blood again, it would devour us. If we fed it the blood of our enemies, of course, it might devour them. [Serpents & Venoms]

# Speculation

[[Snakes]] are relevent. The sun giving blood reminds me of [[The End is Beautiful]]

However, it is probably a reference to [[the Egg Unhatching]].
