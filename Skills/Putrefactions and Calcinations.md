# Description

> 'Death alters; Snow endures.' - [[Solomon Husher]]

> [!skolekosophy] In Ashes
>
All days are death, all lives are sunset. For a time, light persists, but we should not fear the scorch of a Second Dawn. This is [[Skolekosophy]] at its most merciful.

> [!Ithastry] In Flames
>
>All days are death, all lives are sunset. No fire will last without fuel; there can be no Second Dawn without a war to burn the bones of earth. This is [[Ithastry]] at its most merciless.

# Speculation
Obviously we're talking about [[the Second Dawn]].
Husher is likely talking about [[Snow (Hour)]].
