# Description

The precepts of struggle and conflict which drive the cosmic engine of change sometimes called [[the Corrivality]].

> [!ILLUMINATION] Understanding Creates Conflict
> When we name our differences, we learn our enemies. Where there are no names, there are no enemies. This is a matter of the Illumination Wisdom.

> [!Horomachistry] Conflict Creates Gods
> All the Hours are defined by their opposition to other Hours... just as we are defined by the battles we choose. This is a matter of the [[Horomachistry]] Wisdom.
