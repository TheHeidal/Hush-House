>Sometimes we eat the wolf, and sometimes the wolf eats us.

> [!skolekosophy] The Wolf's Beginning
> The Received Version of [[the Book of Suns]] tells us that [[the Wolf-Divided]] was born from [[the Sun-in-Splendour]]'s division. We know from this that the Sun can be reborn only if the Wolf joins the Sun's other selves. Only if the Wolf's hunger is assuaged will it join its other selves. And only the flesh of its other selves can assuage the hunger of the Wolf. A Second Dawn would herald the Last Day. This is the grim lesson of Skolekosophy.

> [!Birdsong] The Wolf's Return
> The Sanctioned Version of the Book of Suns says that the Wolf-Divided was awoken by the Sun's division. We know from this that the Wolf was its own Hour even when the Sun was whole. So we glean and we guess that the Sun might be healed, and the Wolf return to its slumbers. So we glean and guess that a Second Dawn would bring peace, but the Wolf will fight to prevent it. This is Birdsong.
