# Description
>That [[amber]] preserves and is preserved by light; that to hatch is not to die; that [[the Sun]].' There is a place behind the world called the Mansus. Deeds that would be impossible in the world are inevitable there. [[The Watchman]], who knows all the ways of the Mansus, also knows how to make these deeds possible in the waking world.

> [!ILLUMINATION] From Light
> Our dreams are shadows cast by [[the Watchman]]'s light. So we perceive him even in our shadow. This is Illumination.

> [!Nyctodromy] From Change
> We recognise the dream-places that the Watchman shows us, though we have never seen them before. Perhaps we were something else when we saw them. This paradox is fundamental to [[Nyctodromy]].
