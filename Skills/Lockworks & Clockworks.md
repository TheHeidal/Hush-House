Of Clocks  
  
The clocksmith's first duty: when the time comes, the device should speak its purpose. Since [[the Sun-in-Splendour|the Sun]]  [[the Intercalate|was sundered]], Noon is not as it was. Perhaps, if we found the true hour of Noon, we'd know how the Sun might return. Ithastry might give us that answer.

Of Locks  
  
The [[locksmith]]'s first duty: a key for every lock, and a lock for every key. If a key were an Hour, what lock would it open? Skolekosophy might hold the answer.

# Speculation
"Since the Sun was sundered, noon is not how it was". Possibly the [[the Sun-in-Splendour]] was Noon, and now the [[the Sun-in-Rags]] is?
