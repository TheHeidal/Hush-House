# Illumination
> [!ILLUMINATION] The Hours
> Never underestimate the Hour named [[the Meniscate|Meniscate]]. Foolish adepts deride her as an Hour of vanity. What do they think defines the Hours? Light purifies; light exalts.
# Ithastry
> [!Ithastry] The Tree
> Never underestimate the Hour named [[the Madrugad|Madrugad]]. Foolish adepts deride her as an Hour of ashes. What do they think the Watchman's Tree sprang from? Fire purifies; light exalts.


These are the two gods-from glory on Councils!
