# Description

Of wind, woe, and winter.

---
# Hushery
> [!Hushery] Much is Lost
> Still all the winds, still every the beating tongue
Now still the mirrored moon, the sea's cauldron
When nothing's left then nothing is undone.
[[Hushery]]
# Birdsong
> [!Birdsong] Much Remains 
> [[Medusa]]'s Riddle, first: What Is Not Seen?  
The Night, the [[Heart]], the Moon, the Day. Between.  
[[The Keys of Dream#The Palest Key|The palest key]]. The birth-scarred [[the Seven-Coils|Coil Queen]].
This is [[Birdsong]]

# Notes

"the birth-scarred Coil Queen" is a reference to [[the Seven-Coils]], to whom Medusa is known to have a connection. The palest key _could_ reference [[The Keys of Dream]]?

The two titles parallel "much is taken; much abides".
