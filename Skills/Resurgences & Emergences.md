# Description
> Birth and death are only directions. Between the two we find a crossroads.

> [!bosk] Grail and Moth
> The gods-from-Stone made a law that [[the Ligeian Club#The Keys of Dream.|keys of dream]] cannot be held or owned. The time of Stone is past, but the keys remain. So the holders of these keys can only be the seven Ligeians, whose crime has set them outside the law. But the Ligeians serve an Hour of Grail and Moth: when the last remnants of the gods-from-Stone are consumed, the law will be consumed with them. [[The Bosk|Bosk]] is the wisdom of change.

> [!Preservation] Moth and Grail
>The gods-from-Stone made a law that the keys of dream cannot be held or owned. The time of Stone is past, but the keys remain. So the holders of these keys can only be the seven Ligeians, whose crime has set them outside the law. And the Ligeians serve an Hour of Moth and Grail: when the last remnants of the gods-from-Stone are renewed, the law will be renewed with them. [[Preservation]] is the wisdom of renewal.
# Notes
Both commitments give information on [[the Ligeian Club|the Ligeians]] role as holders of the Keys of Dream and Names of [[the Twins]]. The difference is on what will happen to the [[gods-from-stone]], and which of the Twins they serve.
## Bosk
The Ligeians serve the Witch, and the gods from stone will be consumed as in [[Numen - an Irresistible Feast]].
## Preservation
The Ligeians serve the Sister, and the gods-from-stone will be stored.
