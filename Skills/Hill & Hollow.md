> The ways of the hill-children and the [[gods-from-stone]]. Old paths, old secrets, the songs that still echo beneath the earth.

> [!Preservation] How They Endured
> In the beginning, the Carapace Cross served the first Hours, the gods born from stone. When the gods-from-stone were defeated, where could the Cross go? Into the hills; into the Bounds; and into us. This is how humankind came to be, and in our most secret hollows, the Cross endures. This is a matter of Preservation.

> [!Birdsong] How They Began
> In the beginning, [[the Carapace Cross]] served the first Hours, [[gods-from-stone|the gods born from stone]]. And the first of the Carapace Cross were [[the Thritige-kind]], who sought [[the Monarch-at-the-Crossroads]] to rule them wisely and found him in themselves, who began as many and ended as one. This is a riddle, and the riddlemakers know its importance.
