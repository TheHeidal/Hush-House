The Weapon

The greatest and most secret truths can only be recorded by the Librarians of the Watchman's Tree - even then, only beneath the shelter of the Tree's branches, and only in the sanctioned inks called <i>encaustum</i>. There are still certain languages in which these truths might be spoken aloud, but the Hours no longer permit that power in the mouths of mortals, as the wisdom of Horomachistry teaches us.

The Wound

The greatest and most secret truths can only be recorded by the Librarians of [[the Watchman's Tree|the Watchman's Tree]] - even then, only beneath the shelter of the Tree's branches, and only in the sanctioned inks called [[encaustum terminale]]. There are still certain languages in which these secrets can be spoken aloud, but that has never been safe. These secrets are the world's blood, and to speak them aloud is to shed that blood. We who are [[Silence|silent]] have always known this.
