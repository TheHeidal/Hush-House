# Description

'One script that all the world must read, even the blind, and it is written in flames.' Matters of [[fireworks]] and their kin - lights, colours, infernal detonations.

> [!ILLUMINATION] Birth in Fire
> Fire was the first understanding. The Hour named [[The Moth|Moth]] learnt that even before [[the Watchman]] brought light. This is Illumination.

> [!Ithastry] A Red Blossom
> Stories written in fire end all the sooner... but are remembered all the longer. The [[Ithastry]] wisdom teaches us the certainty of change.
