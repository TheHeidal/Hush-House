>The Hunter, the Way, and their memories.
# Skolekosophy
> [!skolekosophy] The Chandler's Path
> When [[the Chandler]] goes a-hunting in the dark of the Wood, he shields his candle so his prey is not forewarned, but he leaves a trail of ivory wax so we may follow him and purchase his prizes. After all, the goal of every hunt is to bring home a trophy, and when we understand [[Skolekosophy]], we know how to bargain.
# The Bosk
> [!bosk] The Moth's Way
> When [[the Moth]] goes a-hunting in the dark of [[The Wood]], he remembers a time when the Wood was bright, but he uses his horns to find the way, and we may follow him if we choose. After all, a trophy is nothing without a hunt: that's the lesson of the Wood.

# Notes

The wood used to be bright?
