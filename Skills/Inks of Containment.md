> When It Is Safe
> Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortalsâ€¦ except in nine great libraries protected by the [[covenant-stones]] they hold, where this knowledge can be safely recorded in the inks called *[[encaustum terminale]]*. These libraries are together called [[the Watchman's Tree]], and the covenant marked by these stones shares that name. All this, then, is a matter of Preservation.
