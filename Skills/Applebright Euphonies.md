# Illumination
> [!ILLUMINATION] What May Be True
> Calyptra is the law that requires secret knowledge to be forgotten - except in the libraries of the Watchman's Tree. The number of the Hours of the Calyptra is three, and we do not trust the third Hour, though we heed her. This paradox is a matter of Illumination.
# The Bosk
> [!bosk] What May Be Known
> [[Calyptra]] is the law that requires secret knowledge to be concealed - except in the libraries of the Watchman's Tree. The number of the Hours of the Calyptra is three, and we do not speak of the oldest Hour. This observance is a matter of Bosk. 
# Notes
Clearly named after [[the Applebright]]. The Bosk lore fairly obviously alludes to the Velvet's being a member of Calyptra. The Illumination lore seems conflicted. Forgetting is the domain of the White Flower, but it seems more likely that we should distrust the Mare-in-the-Tree.
