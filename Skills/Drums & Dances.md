# Description
> The first musics were not made by mortals, but taken; from [[the Seven-Coils]] and [[the Tide|sea-thorn]], from [[the Flint|flint-heart]] and [[the Egg Unhatching|dragon-womb]].

> [!bosk] The Root  
> [[The Thunderskin]], the eternal drum that beats to preserve the skin of the world, is a [[gods-from-flesh|god-from-flesh]], which is to say he was once mortal. He died to preserve the last [[gods-from-stone|god-from-stone]]; he died for love; he died for necessity. In matters of [[The Bosk|Bosk]], these three are often intertwined.

> [!Horomachistry] The Heart
> [[The Thunderskin]], the eternal drum that beats to preserve the skin of the world, is a [[gods-from-flesh|god-from-flesh]], which is to say he was once mortal. But [[the Horned-Axe|the Horned-Axe]], last of the [[gods-from-stone|gods-from-stone]], required his death, and so [[the Red Grail|the Grail]] gave him up, though he loved her. Love is always subject to the will of the Hours, as all [[Horomachistry|horomachists]] know.

# Notes
The description alludes to [[gods-from-stone]], whose deaths lead to the death and ascension of the Thunderskin. See [[The Triple Knot and the Thunderskin]].
