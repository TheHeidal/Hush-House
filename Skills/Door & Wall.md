> [!Nyctodromy] What May Not Be
> There is a prophecy, of a shining City that mortals might build. There is a paradox, that a [[the City Unbuilt|City Unbuilt]] can always be greater than one that exists. The Night Arts teach this resolution: that the gate to that City must be fashioned from [[black sapphire]], and raised in dreams.

[[The Bright Arts]] teach this resolution: that the [[Hours]] will always forbid the raising of that City, so that it will remain a great hope and a great travelling.
