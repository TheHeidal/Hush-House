# [[The Bosk]]
The Root and the Source

In the inmost walled garden of the palace of [[the Shadowless Empire|the Shadowless Kings]] in Persia, there grew a [[Yew]]-tree older than any other. Its root was red, its flowers were black, its berries were white. The Kings would leave their girl-children overnight in the nest of its roots, in memory of the great Mother of their line, and so their daughters were assured health, longevity and wisdom. This is the source of all our science, and this is Bosk.
# [[Preservation]]
The Source and the Root

In the inmost walled garden of the palace of the Shadowless Kings in Persia, there was preserved a [[Yew]]-tree older than any other. The Kings set a bee-hive in its branches, in memory of their forefathers, and they brewed from its flowers a sovereign cure against all poisons. This is the root of all our science, and this is [[Preservation]].
