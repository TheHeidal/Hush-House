> The precepts of occlusion and dissolution; their jealous enforcement is the nature of [[Calyptra|the Calyptra]]
# Preservation
> [!Preservation] Night
> [[The Velvet]] is not the oldest Hour; but she is the oldest Hour of [[Calyptra]]. The Black Flower on the Watchman's Tree is the preservation of secrets, and without it the Tree would fall. This is a matter of [[Preservation]].
# Horomachistry
> [!Horomachistry] Fire
> [[The Mare-in-the-Tree]] is not the youngest Hour; but she is the youngest Hour of [[Calyptra]], for she has been born many times in many places. [[The Red Flower]] on the Watchman's Tree is the fire fuelled by truth, and without it the Tree would fall, as all horomachists know.
