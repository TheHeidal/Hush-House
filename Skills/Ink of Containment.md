# [[Horomachistry]]

When It Is Permitted  
  
Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortalsâ€¦ unless it's wisely contained. This law is named [[Calyptra]]; the enforcement of this law is named Calyptra also; the three Hours who enforce it share that name. They permit that knowledge to persist only in [[the Watchman's Tree|certain sanctioned places]], and the most dangerous secrets must only be recorded in the inks called [[encaustum terminale]]. Horomachistry teaches us Calyptra's importance.
