# Description
> To master boundaries through their determination. The Scar marks wisdom and regrets; one is often born from the other.

> [!ILLUMINATION] The Scar  
[[The Mansus]] is the fortress of dream where the true Hours rule, and [[Nowhere]] is the scar beneath it where [[gods-from-Nowhere|the Nowhere hours]] lair. Without the Hours above, that scar would be an open wound. So the Bright Arts teach us.
