# Directions
## HE
### Library - Crossrow
`crossrow`
> [[the Watchman's Tree#Crossrow|Crossrow]]
> 
> In a garden city of the far West, in an establishment of uncertain age, in a gloriously decaying garden-mansion, you can find perhaps the only library in the world where silence is discouraged. The Watchman and the Vagabond are venerated there, and Sunset Celia's shrine is aligned each day so the dawn may be greeted with music. It claims to be the site of the first Roost, though it's by no means the only place to make that claim. The lights of the house are never extinguished, and its hospitalities, if you can find the place at all, are generally both warm and bright. Perhaps we'll see you there.
> 
> [After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
### Wisdom - Birdsong
`crossrow-birdsong`
> [[Birdsong]]
> Music, riddles, miscellany. The matters of [[the Roost]], of [[Ghirbi]], of [[the Leak]], [[the Vagabond]], [[the Carapace Cross]] and a hundred and five others.
> [We do not cease until we are ceased.]
### Element - Chor
`birdsong-chor`
>[[Chor]]
>Energy and tenacity; rhythm.
>[This tongue is the stone and it is not the stone, the thumb-sucking slayer-stone.]
### Language - Ramsund
> [[Ramsund]]
> 
> This language has been called 'mantiq al-tair' and 'lenga aucel' and 'the speech of birds' and 'Ramsund' and 'the hazelnut tongue', but it's a language of secrets, and its true name may never be used. The aviform Hours use it at their Roost, or so the story goes.
> 
> [A visitor to Crossrow who did not write himself. Perhaps the opposite.]
## RO
### Library - the Invisible Serapeum
`invisible-serapeum`
>[[the Watchman's Tree|Invisible Serapeum]]
>“The first and irreparable disaster was the fall of the Lantern.” Perhaps thanks to the protection of [[the Forge of Days]], the Serapeum has survived the long decline of its parent library. Or perhaps it's just that the Serapeum is invisible to the dull-sighted even once they're inside it. The Forge does not usually favour libraries, but the Serapeum specialises in Forge lore and horomachistry, and favours non-combustible media.
>[After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
### Wisdom - Horomachistry
`invisible-serapeum-horomachistry`
> Horomachistry
> The laws and contentions of the Hours and their emanations. What makes us what we are. Forbiddings and laws and the proper ways to proper roles.
> [What when unobserved?]
### Element - Mettle
>Mettle
>The capacity for meaningful choice.
>[A tongue of bowls and rolls.]
### Language - Deep Mandiac
> Deep Mandaic
> The most secret script of the innermost rites of the deep sects of the deep desert. The birth-tongue, it is claimed, of the Mother of Ants herself.
> [A visitor to the Serapeum of a long-noted significant absence, from a city of thundering milk.]
## MO
### Library - the Haustorium
`haustorium`
> [[the Watchman's Tree#The Haustorium|Haustorium]]
> 
> An enclave beyond the Evening Isles (and in the Bounds) established by an alliance of Catholic friars with Incan magicians. It preserves those things that are elsewhere considered unwise to preserve. The Haustorium lies beneath the hand of the Crowned Growth. It is in no way a safe place to visit, nor even really to communicate with. It's probably not even a good idea to dream about it.
> [After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
### Wisdom - Skolekosophy
`haustorium-skolekosophy`
> [[Skolekosophy]]
> 'The study of things that should not be studied'. Perversions and abrasions, Worms, Nowhere; earthquakes.
> ["Without speech no answer is possible." This is suppressed by the White Door, or perhaps even left outside it, as a sword outside a king's hall or as a key in the door.]
### Element - Shapt
> [[Shapt]]
> Eloquence and understanding. The door opens both ways.
> [This honey'd tongue]
### Language - Hyksos
> Hyksos
> The Shepherd-Kings brought this speech west from Canaan to use in their wards and snares. Had they never come to Egypt, they might never found a way to write it; given its addictive qualities, that might have been for the best.
> [A visitor to the Haustorium who bore away a golden treasure.]
## FE
### Library - Hush House
`hush-house`
>[[Hush House]]
>
>Local records suggest that Hush House was a double monastery – a seventh-century foundation of both monks and nuns. There are two major traditions of its origin. This is the first. 
>“St Columba, with twelve companions, brought Christianity from Ireland to Scotland, and founded a monastery on the blessed isle of Iona, where his bones remained until the Northmen came. But in Brancrug Village they have it that St Columba brought a thirteenth companion, a 'hybrid beauty' named Rowena who was perhaps his tutor, perhaps his seducer, or perhaps his daughter. At his death, the monks sought to stone her for her impurities. She bore Columba's bones away so the monks would not have them (substituting, from tact or mischief, the bones of a horse). She brought them to Brancrug Isle, which even then was a hidden place, to make a double foundation of nuns and monks, and become its first abbess: but she would admit none to the order who was a virgin, nor innocent of any crime. Since then, Brancrug has been a refuge for all the world might consider impure.”
>
>[After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
### Wisdom - Hushery
`hush-house-hushery`
>[[Hushery]]
>Aesthetics, necromancy, silence; the techniques used also by Reckoners.
>[In each of us there's a healing sadness.]
### Element - Trist
> [[Trist]]
> The change and the longing.
> [A tung of yung phanes.]
### Language - Ericapaean
>[[Ericapaean]]
>A language of surpassing beauty and allusiveness, revealed through the ecstatic apprehensions of the Orphics, the Eleusinians, and the Sibyls of the Rhine. Ericapaean, these mystics claimed, allows the elaboration of hues, sensations and states of mind too subtle for grosser tongues.
>[A visitor to Hush House who catalogued a collection that in many histories was first-numbered among the lost. Alternatively, his chrismed unson.]
## SK
### Library - the Yeshiva Tigris
`yeshiva-tigris`
> [[Yeshiva Tigris]]
> For fifty years a secret yeshiva in Tiflis has taught the Four Traditions of [[the Bei Ilai]]: the imprisonment of spirits, the expulsion of monsters, the conclusion of tenacious curses and the sealing of troublesome portals. The YT has had a long and very beneficial understanding with the Fifth Cup, but for the last twenty years has been engaged in a bitter and incomprehensible feud, approximately because someone hasn't returned a book but no one can agree who or what. They specialise in preservation lore, with a strong second string in skolekosophy.
> [After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
### Wisdom - Preservation
> [[Preservation]]
> Healing and restoration; Commandments for the Preservation of All that Exists; Relic Rites of the Sisterhood of the Knot; legacy rites of the Gods-from-Stone.
> [Nothing without.]
### Element - Health
> [[Health]]
> The dwelling-place of the soul.
> [The hand enacts the tongue.]
### Language - Sabazine
> [[Sabazine]]
> There is a History where Alexander defeated first the Great Knot of Sabazos, and then the King of Kings. There is another History where, instead, he learnt from them. How many more? If we curl our hands into the correct shapes, we may yet understand.
> [A visitor to the Yeshiva from whose body flowers shall grow...]
## BL
### Library - Grove of Green Immortals
`grove-of-green-immortals`
> [[the Grove of the Green Immortals|Grove Of Green Immortals]]
> This is a mountain-monastery of renegade Taoists. They specialise in horticulture and medicine, in Moth and Heart lore, in the gossip of the Hours, all under the hand of [[the Applebright]]... but the Grove is supposed to be safe to visit, because of the arrangement the scholars and the Applebright have made.
> [After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
### Wisdom - Bosk
`grove-of-green-immortals-bosk`
> Bosk
> The lore of the primaeval wood; rarely written, often felt.
> [Hath each their darkness.]
### Element - Ereb
> Ereb
> Pride, compassion; hatred and fear.
> [This tongue, silver-caging.]
### Language - Killasimi
> Killasimi
> If there is speech in Nowhere; if there is a language used by the Dead; if the House of the Moon has a native tongue; then it must be Killasimi. If none of this is true, it is still not a language to be spoken in daylight. Each word breathes woe. Read it, as they say, and weep.
> [A visitor to the Grove whose meals came winged east.]
## FO
### Library - Monastery of the fifth cup
`monastery-of-the-fifth-cup`
> [[the Monastery of the Fifth Cup|Monastery Of The Fifth Cup]]
> “Spending on feasting and wine is better than hoarding our substance. That which we give makes us richer, that which is hoarded is lost.” A quietly unorthodox monastery with a tendency to apophatic theology and a strong winemaking tradition. Ithastry is their particular domain, but they're also respected for their boskiness. Of all the nine great storehouses of the wisdoms, the Fifth Cup possesses the fewest actual books. Most of their knowledge is encoded in their wines, or in the devices in their triple-locked cellars, or in the skulls of the brethren. “Never spoken, never stolen.”
> [After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
### Wisdom - Ithastry
> [[Ithastry]]
> Crafting, locksmithing, pyrotechnics: the arts that alter. Mirror alloys, the Noble Endeavour, the Corrivality. 
> [All the living have it. Many of the dead retain it. Books have only this… at least those books that can be trusted.]
### Element - Wist
> [[Wist]]
> Name, memory, that part which remains.
> [A tongue twice never Lydian.]
### Language - Fucine
> [[Fucine]]
> A people lived east of the lost lake Fucino. Horace warned that theirs was the land of witches. This was their language, called by some 'the dry tongue' and by others 'the tongue of witches'.
> [A tricksy sheep-pot visitor, or guest.]
## SC
### Library - Labyrinth of Lions
`labyrinth-of-lions`
> [[the Labyrinth of Lions|Labyrinth Of Lions]]
> The Labyrinth of Lions teaches horomachistry and Illumination. In [[the First History]], it was established as a labyrinth-fortress in the lands of [[the Shadowless Empire|the Shadowless King-of-Kings]]. When days were yet undivided, it lay under the hand of the Sun. Now [[the Lionsmith]] lends his protection. For twenty-two centuries, mystics, strategists, and sorrowful warriors have all sought to penetrate its coils in an attempt to advance their understanding.
> [After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
### Wisdom - Illumination
> [[Illumination]]
> Mystical exercises to purify and illuminate the self and its surroundings. Relic Rites of the Unconquered Sun, mirrors and light sources, the Glory.
> [We have all benefited from the Glory's gifts.]
### Element - Phost
> [[Phost]]
> Sight, perception, inspiration, all the Glory's gifts.
> [One tongue, many eyes.]
### Language - Cracktrack
> [[Cracktrack]]
> In the Tracks of Beasts, in the Convolutions of his own Carapace, in Egg-vein and Shell-shadow, the Many-Eyed One found the Signs which can be History.
> [A visitor to the Labyrinth, torch-named, who can never return, only alight]
## KN
### Library - Tomb of Lies
`tomb-of-lies`
> [[the Tomb of Lies|Tomb Of Lies]]
> [[Great Hooded Princes|The Great Hooded Princes]] do not reveal their library's location. Those few permitted entry will say only that it's 'west of the Lion, and north of Victory'. It contains knowledge on the ways and foundations of the Mansus; on the Fifth History, and above all on Knock lore. The Princes do not say 'Knowledge is Power', but rather, 'Power is Knowledge.' Relationships between the Princes and the Mother of Ants are strained, and the Tomb lies under the hand of [[the Horned Axe]].
> [After this place, a suitable wisdom.]
> You've achieved the first degree, 'library', of the KN direction of the Enigma of Secret Histories. You're entitled to use this badge wherever you like, either the full version or the transparent overlay.
### Wisdom - Nyctodromy
`tomb-of-lies-nyctodromy`
>[[Nyctodromy]]
>'Travelling at night.' The ways and byways of other worlds. 
>[Sometimes our reach exceeds our grasp, but in dreams our grasp can exceed our reach.]
>You've achieved the second degree, 'wisdom', of the KN direction of the Enigma of Secret Histories. You're entitled to use this badge wherever you like, either the full version or the transparent overlay.
### Element - Fet
`nyctodromy-fet`
> [[Fet]]
> That part of us which dreams. The connection to the Mansus.
> [This tongue, entrance into secret light.]
### Language - Vak
> [[Vak]]
> Before gods arose from blood, before ever ape stood upright, this was the language heard in the House of the Sun…. 'I am Vak,' the Peacock Door boasted, 'both the tongue and the Goddess. I am the only entrance into secret light. I was worshipped before you upright apes, and I will be still when all of you are ugly ash. Listen, and I will prove it
> [A visitor to the Tomb who knew the value of seventy-seven winks.]
